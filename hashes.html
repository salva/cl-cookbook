<a name="intro"></a>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

Hash Tables are a powerful data structure, associating 
keys with values in a very efficient way. Hash Tables 
are often preferred over association lists whenever 
performance is an issue, but they introduce a little 
overhead that makes assoc lists better if there are 
only a few key-value pairs to maintain. 


<a name="create"></a>
<h3>Creating a Hash Table</h3> 

Hash Tables are created using the function 
<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/reference/HyperSpec/Body/f_mk_has.htm"><code>MAKE-HASH-TABLE</code></a>.
It has no required argument. Its most used optional keyword argument
is <code>:TEST</code>, specifying the function used to test the
equality of keys.


<a name="get"></a>
<h3>Getting a value from a Hash Table</h3> 

The function 
<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/reference/HyperSpec/Body/f_gethas.htm"><code>GETHASH</code></a>
takes two required arguments: a 
key and a hash table. It returns two values: the value 
corresponding to the key in the hash table (or NIL if 
not found), and a boolean indicating whether the key 
was found in the table. That second value is necessary 
since NIL is a valid value in a key-value pair, so 
getting NIL as first value from <code>GETHASH</code> does not 
necessarily mean that the key was not found in the 
table.   


<a name="add"></a>
<h3>Adding an Element to a Hash Table</h3>

If you want to add an element to a hash table, you can use 
<code>GETHASH</code>, the function to retrieve elements from the hash
table, in conjunction with 
<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/reference/HyperSpec/Body/m_setf_.htm"><code>SETF</code></a>.

<pre>
* (defparameter *my-hash* (make-hash-table))
*MY-HASH*
* (setf (gethash 'one-entry *my-hash*) "one")
"one"
* (setf (gethash 'another-entry *my-hash*) 2/4)
1/2
* (gethash 'one-entry *my-hash*)
"one"
T
* (gethash 'another-entry *my-hash*)
1/2
T
</pre>


<a name="test"></a>
<h3>Testing for the Presence of a Key in a Hash Table</h3>

The first value returned by GETHASH is the object in the hash table
that's associated with the key you provided as an argument to
GETHASH or NIL if no value exists for this key. This value can act
as a <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/reference/HyperSpec/Body/26_glo_g.htm#generalized_boolean">generalized
boolean</a> if you want to test for the presence of keys.

<pre>
* (defparameter *my-hash* (make-hash-table))
*MY-HASH*
* (setf (gethash 'one-entry *my-hash*) "one")
"one"
* (if (gethash 'one-entry *my-hash*)
    "Key exists"
    "Key does not exist")
"Key exists"
* (if (gethash 'another-entry *my-hash*)
    "Key exists"
    "Key does not exist")
"Key does not exist"
</pre>

But note that this does <em>not</em> work if NIL is amongst the
values that you want to store in the hash.

  <pre>
;;; continued from above
* (setf (gethash 'another-entry *my-hash*) nil)
NIL
* (if (gethash 'another-entry *my-hash*)
    "Key exists"
    "Key does not exist")
"Key does not exist"
</pre>

In this case you'll have to check the <em>second</em> return value of GETHASH
which will always return NIL if no value is found and T otherwise.
  
<pre>
;;; continued from above
* (if (nth-value 1 (gethash 'another-entry *my-hash*))
    "Key exists"
    "Key does not exist")
"Key exists"
* (if (nth-value 1 (gethash 'no-entry *my-hash*))
    "Key exists"
    "Key does not exist")
"Key does not exist"
</pre>  


<a name="del"></a>
<h3>Deleting from a Hash Table</h3>

Use <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/reference/HyperSpec/Body/f_remhas.htm"><code>REMHASH</code></a>
to delete a hash entry. Both the key and its associated value
will be removed from the hash table. REMHASH returns T if there was
such an entry, NIL otherwise.

<pre>
* (defparameter *my-hash* (make-hash-table))
*MY-HASH*
* (setf (gethash 'first-key *my-hash*) 'one)
ONE
* (gethash 'first-key *my-hash*)
ONE
T
* (remhash 'first-key *my-hash*)
T
* (gethash 'first-key *my-hash*)
NIL
NIL
* (gethash 'no-entry *my-hash*)
NIL
NIL
* (remhash 'no-entry *my-hash*)
NIL
* (gethash 'no-entry *my-hash*)
NIL
NIL
</pre>


<a name="traverse"></a>
<h3>Traversing a Hash Table</h3>

If you want to perform an action on each entry (i.e., each key-value
pair) in a hash table, you have several options:
<p>

You can use <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/reference/HyperSpec/Body/f_maphas.htm"><code>MAPHASH</code></a> 
which iterates over all entries in the hash table. Its first argument
must be a function which accepts <em>two</em> arguments, the key and
the value of each entry. Note that due to the nature of hash tables
you <em>can't</em> control the order in which the entries are provided
by MAPHASH (or other traversing constructs). MAPHASH always returns NIL.

<pre>
* (defparameter *my-hash* (make-hash-table))
*MY-HASH*
* (setf (gethash 'first-key *my-hash*) 'one)
ONE
* (setf (gethash 'second-key *my-hash*) 'two)
TWO
* (setf (gethash 'third-key *my-hash*) nil)
NIL
* (setf (gethash nil *my-hash*) 'nil-value)
NIL-VALUE
* (defun print-hash-entry (key value)
    (format t "The value associated with the key ~S is ~S~%" key value))
PRINT-HASH-ENTRY
* (maphash #'print-hash-entry *my-hash*)
The value associated with the key FIRST-KEY is ONE
The value associated with the key SECOND-KEY is TWO
The value associated with the key THIRD-KEY is NIL
The value associated with the key NIL is NIL-VALUE
</pre>

You can also use <a
href="http://www.lispworks.com/reference/HyperSpec/Body/m_w_hash.htm"><code>WITH-HASH-TABLE-ITERATOR</code></a>, a macro which turns
(via <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/reference/HyperSpec/Body/s_flet_.htm"><code>MACROLET</code></a>)
its first argument into an iterator that on each invocation returns
three values per hash table entry - a generalized boolean that's true
if an entry is returned, the key of the entry, and the value of the
entry. If there are no more entries, only one value is returned - NIL.

<pre>
;;; same hash-table as above
* (with-hash-table-iterator (my-iterator *my-hash*)
    (loop
      (multiple-value-bind (entry-p key value)
          (my-iterator)
        (if entry-p
            (print-hash-entry key value)
            (return)))))
The value associated with the key FIRST-KEY is ONE
The value associated with the key SECOND-KEY is TWO
The value associated with the key THIRD-KEY is NIL
The value associated with the key NIL is NIL-VALUE
NIL
</pre>

Note the following caveat from the HyperSpec: "It is unspecified what
happens if any of the implicit interior state of an iteration is
returned outside the dynamic extent of the
<code>WITH-HASH-TABLE-ITERATOR</code> form such as by returning some
closure over the invocation form."
<p>

And there's always <a
href="http://www.lispworks.com/reference/HyperSpec/Body/06_a.htm"><code>LOOP</code></a>:

<pre>
;;; same hash-table as above
* (loop for key being the hash-keys of *my-hash*
        do (print key))
FIRST-KEY 
SECOND-KEY 
THIRD-KEY 
NIL 
NIL
* (loop for key being the hash-keys of *my-hash*
        using (hash-value value)
        do (format t "The value associated with the key ~S is ~S~%" key value))
The value associated with the key FIRST-KEY is ONE
The value associated with the key SECOND-KEY is TWO
The value associated with the key THIRD-KEY is NIL
The value associated with the key NIL is NIL-VALUE
NIL
* (loop for value being the hash-values of *my-hash*
        do (print value))
ONE 
TWO 
NIL 
NIL-VALUE 
NIL
* (loop for value being the hash-values of *my-hash*
        using (hash-key key)
        do (format t "~&~A -> ~A" key value))
FIRST-KEY -> ONE
SECOND-KEY -> TWO
THIRD-KEY -> NIL
NIL -> NIL-VALUE
NIL
</pre>


<a name="count"></a>
<h3>Counting the Entries in a Hash Table</h3>

No need to use your fingers - Common Lisp has a built-in function to
do it for you: <a
href="http://www.lispworks.com/reference/HyperSpec/Body/f_hash_1.htm"><code>HASH-TABLE-COUNT</code></a>.

<pre>
* (defparameter *my-hash* (make-hash-table))
*MY-HASH*
* (hash-table-count *my-hash*)
0
* (setf (gethash 'first *my-hash*) 1)
1
* (setf (gethash 'second *my-hash*) 2)
2
* (setf (gethash 'third *my-hash*) 3)
3
* (hash-table-count *my-hash*)
3
* (setf (gethash 'second *my-hash*) 'two)
TWO
* (hash-table-count *my-hash*)
3
* (clrhash *my-hash*)
#<EQL hash table, 0 entries {48205F35}>
* (hash-table-count *my-hash*)
0
</pre>


<a name="size"></a>
<h3>Performance Issues: The Size of your Hash Table</h3>

The <code>MAKE-HASH-TABLE</code> function has a couple of optional
parameters which control the initial size of your hash table and how
it'll grow if it needs to grow. This can be an important performance
issue if you're working with large hash tables. Here's an (admittedly
not very scientific) example with <a
href="http://www.cons.org/cmucl">CMUCL</a> pre-18d on Linux:

<pre>
* (defparameter *my-hash* (make-hash-table))
*MY-HASH*
* (hash-table-size *my-hash*)
65
* (hash-table-rehash-size *my-hash*)
1.5
* (time (dotimes (n 100000) (setf (gethash n *my-hash*) n)))
Compiling LAMBDA NIL: 
Compiling Top-Level Form: 

Evaluation took:
  0.27 seconds of real time
  0.25 seconds of user run time
  0.02 seconds of system run time
  0 page faults and
  8754768 bytes consed.
NIL
* (time (dotimes (n 100000) (setf (gethash n *my-hash*) n)))
Compiling LAMBDA NIL: 
Compiling Top-Level Form: 

Evaluation took:
  0.05 seconds of real time
  0.05 seconds of user run time
  0.0 seconds of system run time
  0 page faults and
  0 bytes consed.
NIL
</pre>

The values for <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/reference/HyperSpec/Body/f_hash_4.htm"><code>HASH-TABLE-SIZE</code></a> and <a
href="http://www.lispworks.com/reference/HyperSpec/Body/f_hash_2.htm"><code>HASH-TABLE-REHASH-SIZE</code></a> are
implementation-dependent. In our case, CMUCL chooses and initial size
of 65, and it will increase the size of the hash by 50 percent
whenever it needs to grow. Let's see how often we have to re-size the
hash until we reach the final size...

<pre>
* (log (/ 100000 65) 1.5)
18.099062
* (let ((size 65)) (dotimes (n 20) (print (list n size)) (setq size (* 1.5 size))))
(0 65) 
(1 97.5) 
(2 146.25) 
(3 219.375) 
(4 329.0625) 
(5 493.59375) 
(6 740.3906) 
(7 1110.5859) 
(8 1665.8789) 
(9 2498.8184) 
(10 3748.2275) 
(11 5622.3413) 
(12 8433.512) 
(13 12650.268) 
(14 18975.402) 
(15 28463.104) 
(16 42694.656) 
(17 64041.984) 
(18 96062.98) 
(19 144094.47) 
NIL
</pre>

The hash has to be re-sized 19 times until it's big enough to hold
100,000 entries. That explains why we saw a lot of consing and why it
took rather long to fill the hash table. It also explains why the
second run was much faster - the hash table already had the correct
size.
Here's a faster way to do it:
If we know in advance how big our hash will be, we can start with the
right size:

<pre>
* (defparameter *my-hash* (make-hash-table :size 100000))
*MY-HASH*
* (hash-table-size *my-hash*)
100000
* (time (dotimes (n 100000) (setf (gethash n *my-hash*) n)))
Compiling LAMBDA NIL: 
Compiling Top-Level Form: 

Evaluation took:
  0.04 seconds of real time
  0.04 seconds of user run time
  0.0 seconds of system run time
  0 page faults and
  0 bytes consed.
NIL
</pre>

That's obviously much faster. And there was no consing involved
because we didn't have to re-size at all. If we don't know the final
size in advance but can guess the growth behaviour of our hash table
we can also provide this value to <code>MAKE-HASH-TABLE</code>. We can
provide an integer to specify absolute growth or a float to specify
relative growth.

<pre>
* (defparameter *my-hash* (make-hash-table :rehash-size 100000))
*MY-HASH*
* (hash-table-size *my-hash*)
65
* (hash-table-rehash-size *my-hash*)
100000
* (time (dotimes (n 100000) (setf (gethash n *my-hash*) n)))
Compiling LAMBDA NIL: 
Compiling Top-Level Form: 

Evaluation took:
  0.07 seconds of real time
  0.05 seconds of user run time
  0.01 seconds of system run time
  0 page faults and
  2001360 bytes consed.
NIL
</pre>

Also rather fast (we only needed one re-size) but much more consing
because almost the whole hash table (minus 65 initial elements) had to
be built during the loop.
<p>

Note that you can also specify the <code>REHASH-THRESHOLD</code> while
creating a new hash table. One final remark: Your implementation is
allowed to <em>completely ignore</em> the values provided for
<code>REHASH-SIZE</code> and <code>REHASH-THRESHOLD</code>...
