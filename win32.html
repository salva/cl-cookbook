<h3>Introduction and Scope</h3>

<p>This chapter introduces the basics of the Win32 API, demonstrates
how it can be called from Lisp, and shows how Lisp can be used to
create a powerful Win32 programming environment optimized for a
specific application domain.  Any such Lisp environment exposing every
option in the Win32 API must be at least as complex as the Win32 API.
However, it is hard to imagine a given application domain needing
every option of every function in the Win32 API.  Extending Lisp's
syntax in a domain-specific manner hides those parts of the Win32 API
superfluous to the domain. (Most likely the majority of the Win32 API
will be hidden.)  The programmer then deals with and thinks about only
those pieces of the API needed for the task at hand.  Pieces of the
Win32 API needed later are easily exposed at any time.

<p>A single environment is not easily optimized for both simple and
 complex applications.  The methods outlined in this chapter can be
 used to construct environments, from simple to complex, appropriate
 for a range of application domains.

<p>The beginning sections of the chapter introduce concepts and ideas
leading to the penultimate section, which concludes with a "Hello"
program:

<p><code><pre>
(require "win-header")
(in-package :wh)
(export '(initialize-appendix-b))

(DefMsgHandler appendix-b-proc MsgMap ()
  (WM_PAINT
    (text-out "Hello from Lisp!" 0 0 :color (RGB 0 0 255))
    0))

(defun initialize-appendix-b ()
  (DefActiveTopWindow "Hello" 'appendix-b-proc
    :style ws_overlappedwindow :width 150 :height 200 :title "Hello Program"))
</pre></code>

<p>Lispworks for Windows</a> version 4.2.7 is used.  (The Personal
Edition is available for free download.) No attempt is made to
accomodate other Lisps and no thought is given to cross-platform
compatibility.  These ideas were discussed when outlining this
document and the current approach decided upon because:

<ul>

<li>It is good to publish early and publish often. Reducing the scope
fits this philosophy.  Other Lisps can be included at a later time.  I
know that <a href="http://www.cormanlisp.com">Corman Lisp</a> is one
that includes a lot of Win32 API capabilities.  I don't have
experience with other vendor's Lisps, so look at them all.

<li>The information presented should apply generally to other vendor's
Lisps.  The foreign language interface may change but Win32 remains
the same.


</ul>

The Cookbook welcomes contributions broadening coverage in these (and
other) areas.

<p>Anyone programming for the Win32 API should be familiar with 
<a href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/pw5/index.html">
Programming Windows, The Definitive Guide to the Win32 API</a> by
Charles Petzold, or a comparable book.  

<p>The code presented here has been tested only with Lispworks for
Windows 4.2.7 Professional Edition under Windows XP.

<h3>Why Use Lisp with Win32?</h3>

If a program can be cross-platform, it should be.  The <i>Common</i>
in Common Lisp is a tribute to the cross-platform, and cross-vendor,
nature of Common Lisp.  The advantages of this portability are not
ignored lightly.  However, writing programs which take advantage of
the Win32 API in a non-portable fashion is not a mandate for doing so
without the power of Lisp at one's fingertips.

<p>One concern some may have is the perception that Lisp executables
are large.  Microsoft operating systems are written in C and C++.  The
supporting libraries for C/C++ programs come with the operating
system.  Lisp run-time support looks large only because it does not
come with the OS.  It is possible to ship Lisp programs in delivery
mode, especially with Lispworks for Windows which requires no
royalties for this, and it is possible to ship the run-time once and
then ship small, compiled programs as they become available.

<p>If the requirement is to create small programs suitable for public
download in large volumes, the fact that Lisp runtime support is not
loaded on most computers is a limitation.  However, Lispworks for
Windows allows aggressive pruning during the delivery stage and
programs can sometimes be reduced below two megabytes, which is
suitable for many download situations.  Situations requiring the full
Lisp run-time are most likely large applications where it makes sense
to deliver the runtime on CD, or via a large one-time download, and
later deliver individually-compiled components which are loaded
during program or component initialization.

<p>It is my understanding that the lower limit on delivered program
size is not inherent to Lisp as a language but only a result of
current market demand.  As market demand grows for truly small
stand-alone executable programs written in Lisp, vendors will have
incentive to spend time developing better pruners and shakers. (Lisp
starts with a lot and removes what's not needed to produce a
deliverable while C/C++ starts with a little and adds what's needed
during the link phase.  A freshly-run Lisp begins with a REPL, a
read-eval-print loop, with the full power of Lisp available
interactively and ready for use.)  

<p>Seeing the gory details of Lispwork's Foreign Language Interface,
or FLI, may seem strange at first.  The OS is written in C/C++, so OS
calls from C/C++ are not foreign calls, just as Lisp functions called
from Lisp functions are not foreign calls.



<a name="apioverview"></a>
<h3>A (Very) Brief Overview of a Win32 Program's Life</h3>

The OS treats a Win32 GUI program as a set of subroutines, or functions.  

<ul>

<li>The first of these functions, WinMain, is called when the program is
initialized.

<li>WinMain calls the Win32 function RegisterClass to inform the OS of
the location of a callback function.  Serveral calls may be made to
RegisterClass but only one of these calls, naming one callback
function, serves the primary window of the application. After
RegisterClass is called, the OS knows about the newly-defined class.

<li>The Win32 function CreateWindowEx is called and given the class
name specified on a previous RegisterClass call. Now the window exists
and, depending upon the parameters passed to CreateWindowEx, is visible.

<li>The OS begins queueing messages relating to the newly-created
window.  The queue is saved for delivery to WinMain. 

<li>WinMain accesses the message queue in a loop referred to as a
<i>message pump</i>. The message pump loop calls GetMessage,
TranslateMessage, and DispatchMessage. 

<li>GetMessage retrieves one message from the queue. There is some
method or dependability to the sequence in which messages are
queued. A certain sequence of messages is queued when a window is
created, for instance.  Events, such as mouse movements, cause other
messages to be queued.

<li>TranslateMessage translates virtual-key messages to character
messages.  DispatchMessage is a call to the OS requesting the OS to
handle the message.  The OS handles the message by calling another
subroutine, or function, in the application program.  The application
function which is called is the function specified in a call to
RegisterClass, which included a class name parameter, where that class
name was specified in the call to CreateWindowEx. (Phew).

<li>The application function specified in the RegisterClass call takes
four parameters:

<ol>

<li>a handle to the window associated with the message

<li>the message id, an integer

<li>a wParam unsigned long

<li>an lParam unsigned long

</ol>

<li>The semantics of wParam and lParam vary depending upon the message id.

<li>The application function contains the equivalent of a case
statement, switching on the message id.  There are many (hundreds of)
message ids.  Common ones include wm_create, sent when a window is
created, wm_paint, sent when a window's contents are to be drawn, and
wm_destroy, sent when a window is about to go away.  Other messages
are generated in response to events such as key presses, mouse
movements, and mouse button clicks.  There are windows messages
related to displaying video from attached cameras, capturing or
playing sound files, dialing telephones, and much more.  There are
thousands of these messages in the OS but any given program normally
deals with a small subset of them.  When a message function receives a
message with which it does not deal explicitly, the message is
passed to a Win32 default function.

<li>When a menu command or other event causes the program to enter
code which calls the Win32 function PostQuitMessage, the message pump
returns zero from GetMessage, which is the cue to exit the message
pump loop.  WinMain then exits and the program ends.

</ul>


<a name="unicode"></a>
<h3>Windows Character Systems and Lisp</h3>

Some Microsoft operating systems use a single-byte, ASCII, character
set and others use a double-byte, Unicode, character set.  Use

<p><code><pre>
(defun external-format ()
  (if (string= (software-type) "Windows NT")
      :unicode
    :ascii)
</pre></code>

to determine which format is in use. Win32 functions taking or
returning characters or strings come in two flavors: 1) those ending
in A for ASCII characters and 2) those ending in W for wide Unicode
characters.  This external-format function is useful primarily when
calling <code>fli:with-foreign-string</code>, part of the Lispworks
foreign function interface.  When defining Win32 functions in the
Foreign Function Interface, or FLI, the presence of the keyword :dbcs
indicates that the function has both a single-byte and a double-byte
version.  When :dbcs is present, Lispworks appends an "A" to the
function name in single-byte Windows 95 and a "W" in double-byte
Windows NT/2000/XP. (I wrote and tested the example program (see
Appendix A) under Windows XP.) Without :dbcs, Lispworks leaves the
foreign function name unchanged.

<p>One FLI definition for the Win32 TextOut function is:

<p><code><pre>
(fli:define-foreign-function
    (TextOut "TextOut" :dbcs :calling-convention :stdcall)
    ((HDC (:unsigned :long)) (nXStart (:unsigned :int)) (nYStart (:unsigned :int)) 
     (lpString :pointer) (cbString (:unsigned :int)))
  :result-type (:unsigned :long))
</pre></code>

which is equivalent to:

<p><code><pre>
(fli:define-foreign-function
    (TextOut "TextOutW" :calling-convention :stdcall)
    ((HDC (:unsigned :long)) (nXStart (:unsigned :int)) (nYStart (:unsigned :int)) 
     (lpString :pointer) (cbString (:unsigned :int)))
  :result-type (:unsigned :long))
</pre></code>

<p>under NT/2000/XP (the second example would use "TextOutA" under 95).

<p>To demonstrate this, let's use a simple FLI definition
which is easy to call interactively for testing purposes.  We are
trying only to see if a given Win32 function is known to the OS. In the
following REPL interaction, the return result is important only when
the Lisp restart handler is invoked. When the restart handler is not
invoked, the Win32 function was found, loaded and called. Trying to
call a Win32 function which the FLI cannot find results in an
invocation of the restart handler. (The correct
define-foreign-function definition for textout can be found in
<a href="#appendixa">Appendix A</a>


<p><code><pre>
CL-USER 9 > (fli:define-foreign-function 
                    (TextOut-1 "TextOut" :dbcs :calling-convention :stdcall)
		    () :result-type :int)
TEXTOUT-1

CL-USER 10 > (textout-1)
1

CL-USER 11 > (fli:define-foreign-function 
                    (TextOut-2 "TextOut" :dbcs :calling-convention :stdcall)
		    () :result-type :int)
TEXTOUT-2

CL-USER 12 > (textout-2)
0
</pre></code>

<br>The <code>TextOut</code> function was found both times.  This
shows that a given Win32 function can be named in more than one FLI
definition. This technique is sometimes useful when more than one Lisp
datatype can satisfy the requirements for a parameter of the Win32
function.

<p><code><pre>
CL-USER 13 > (fli:define-foreign-function 
                    (TextOut-3 "TextOutW" :dbcs :calling-convention :stdcall)
		    () :result-type :int)

TEXTOUT-3

CL-USER 14 > (textout-3)

Error: Foreign function TEXTOUT-3 trying to call to unresolved 
external function "TextOutWW".

  1 (abort) Return to level 0.
  2 Return to top-level loop.
  3 Return from multiprocessing.

Type :b for backtrace, :c <option number> to proceed,  or :? for other
options

CL-USER 15 : 1 > :top

CL-USER 16 > (fli:define-foreign-function 
                    (TextOut-4 "TextOutW" :calling-convention :stdcall)
		    () :result-type :int)

TEXTOUT-4

CL-USER 17 > (textout-4)
1

CL-USER 18 > (fli:define-foreign-function 
                    (TextOut-5 "TextOutA" :calling-convention :stdcall)
		    () :result-type :int)
TEXTOUT-5

CL-USER 19 > (textout-5)
0

CL-USER 20 > 
</pre></code>

<br>I elided a warning Lispworks gives after multiple definitions of a
foreign function when the previous definition differs in its use of
the :dbcs keyword from the current definition's use. After
CL-USER 14, Lispworks complains about "TextOutWW", which shows that
using the :dbcs keyword causes Lispworks to append a 'W' to the
foreign function's name, although the existence of the foreign
function itself is not verified until an actual call is
made. TextOut-5 verifies the existence of the Win32 function TextOutA,
which is the ASCII version of TextOut.

<p>I have seen strange character sets in titles and other places and
have been able to resolve those problems by ensuring I made consistent
use of the :dbcs and/or W/A declarations.

<p>Edi Weitz asked if the :dbcs keyword decides at compile time or at
run time which function to call, the ...A or the ...W.  I wrote the
following program:

<p><code><pre>
(in-package :cl-user)

(fli:define-foreign-function
  (MessageBox "MessageBox" :dbcs :calling-convention :stdcall)
  ((hwnd (:unsigned :long)) (text (:unsigned :long)) (title (:unsigned :long)) (flags (:unsigned :long)))
 :result-type (:unsigned :long))

(defun external-format ()
  (if (string= (software-type) "Windows NT")
      :unicode
    :ascii))

(defun display-format-used ()
  (fli:with-foreign-string 
   (unicode-p u-ec u-bc :external-format (external-format)) "Unicode"
    (fli:with-foreign-string 
     (ascii-p a-ec a-bc :external-format (external-format)) "Ascii"
      (fli:with-foreign-string
       (title-p t-ec t-bc :external-format (external-format)) "External Format"
        (if (eq (external-format) :unicode)
	    (messagebox 0 (fli:pointer-address unicode-p)
	      (fli:pointer-address title-p) 0)
	  (messagebox 0 (fli:pointer-address ascii-p)
	    (fli:pointer-address title-p) 0))))))

(compile 'external-format)
(compile 'display-format-used)

(deliver 'display-format-used "dbcs-run" 5)
(quit)

; We then have dbcs-run.exe.  When run on Windows XP, dbcs-run pops up a messagebox
; displaying "Unicode".  The same dbcs-run.exe file, ftp'd to a Macintosh running OS 9 with
; Virtual PC running Windows 98, pops up a message box displaying "Ascii".

<h3>FLI - The Foreign Language Interface - Translating C Header Files to Lisp</h3>

When calling the Win32 API from C/C++, header files provided with the
compiler are <code>#include</code>d in the program.  The header files
contain the definitions of constants, structures, and functions
comprising the API.  These definitions must be available to the Lisp
program.  I find it most straightforward to do this conversion by
hand.  Although there are automated methods, doing it manually does
not take long on a per-function basis.  

<p>In C/C++, the <code>#define</code>s exist in the preprocessor.
Only those <code>define</code>s used by the program are included in
the object code.  With Lisp, the <code>defconstants</code> are all
loaded into the Lisp image, whether or not they are subsequently
used. I do not know a clean solution for this issue.

<p>In the meantime, I make a base, or core, win-header.lisp and use
other .lisp files, grouped by functionality, for less-frequently-used
definitions, loading those .lisp files when I need them.


<a name="fli-types"></a>
<h4>FLI Data Types</h4>

The Win32 C/C++ header files include many typedefs for OS-specific
data types, including HINSTANCE, HANDLE, HMENU, LPCTSTR, and more.
Regarding Lisp, these essentially boil down to signed or unsigned,
long or char, and singleton or array, or C structures composed of those
types. (Int seems to be the same as long.)


<p>Lisp does not know or care about the difference between an
HINSTANCE and an HMENU.  They both are simply 32-bit values. Lisp pays
attention to these values at two different points in time: 1) when
moving Lisp data to a foreign field and 2) when moving the foreign
data to Lisp. Lispworks attempts coercion at those points and
conditions result when incorrect attempts are made to do conversions
like stuffing a negative value into an unsigned field.  If more hints
about type are given to Lisp, such as declaring a foreign field to be
of type :pointer, Lisp will complain when trying to stuff zero into
the pointer.  That is not handy if one is trying to pass a null
pointer to the OS.  Thus, I find it easier to call most parameters
long, although I bend that rule from time to time.

<p>Lispworks FLI pointers are actually a Lisp structure containing an
address retrieved, or unboxed, by fli:pointer-address.  When passing a
pointer value to the OS, for example when passing the address of a
<code>RECT</code> to <code>GetClientRect</code>, there are two steps
that need to happen: 1) allocate the foreign structure and 2) pass the
address of that allocated structure to the OS.  Most of the time these
allocations are best handled with
<code>fli:with-dynamic-foreign-objects</code> enclosing calls to
<code>fli:allocate-dynamic-foreign-object</code> because one doesn't
have to worry about deallocations. I pass the address of the allocated
structure using <code>fli:pointer-address</code> (unboxing the pointer
value) and define the field in the foreign function's parameter list
as an unsigned long. 

<p>The FLI allows things to be defined such that Lispworks will try
automatic coercion (unboxing).  Try defining the parameter type as
:pointer.  However, Lispworks complains when trying to pass a NULL
pointer, although I did not try creating a FLI pointer with address
zero.  The approach I chose, calling pointers unsigned longs, is clear
to me and works well in both directions (OS->Lisp, Lisp->OS).  This
may simply be a result of my current lack of complete understanding
and there may be a better way.

<p>On occasion is it helpful to define C arrays inside C structures, in
particular in <code>sPAINTSTRUCT</code>. This works but I don't like
my current method of obtaining the address of structure members or
array entries.  I find myself counting byte offsets by hand and using
something like:

<p><code><pre>
(defun interior-copy (to-struct-ptr byte-offset src-ptr)
  (let ((ptr (fli:make-pointer 
              :address (fli:pointer-address to-struct-ptr :type :char))))
     (fli:incf-pointer ptr byte-offset)
     (wcscpy (fli:pointer-address ptr) (fli:pointer-address src-ptr))))
</pre></code>

<br>where wcscpy, the wide-character version of strcpy, is defined
through the FLI.  I hope there's a better way to do this and that
someone quickly teaches me.  I haven't worked enough with different
OSes and Lispworks to know the best way to choose strcpy vs. wcscpy,
other than to use (software-type) to decide which to call. (Or use
(external-format), defined in Appendix A.)

<p>Although the data types defined to Lisp are kept a minimum, it is
very useful for documentation purposes to mimic the typedef names used
in the C/C++ header files. Thus <code>fli:define-c-typedef</code> is
used to define BOOL, DWORD, HANDLE, HDC, and other similar Win32 data
types.

<p>Many OS-specific constants must be made available to the Lisp
program:

<p><code><pre>
(defconstant CW_USEDEFAULT       #x80000000)
(defconstant IDC_ARROW                32512)
(defconstant SW_SHOW                      5)
(defconstant WM_CLOSE            #x00000010)
(defconstant WM_DESTROY          #x00000002)
</pre></code>

<p>These constants are given by name, without values, in the MSDN
documentation.  The Lisp program needs not only the name but also the
value. An easy way to find the necessary values is to grep through the
VC98/Include directory.  Visual Studio contains a "find in files"
function on its toolbar which allows this kind of search. Kenny Tilton
says, "What I did was grab any VC++ project that builds (the NeHe
OpenGL site is full of VC++ projects (see OpenGL tutorials in sidebar
to left of the page at <a
href="http://nehe.gamedev.net">http:///nehe.gamedev.net</a>) which
built without a problem for me) and then right-click on the symbol I
was curious about. (Of > course first you have to find a reference
<g>.) VC++ then offers 'find definition' and will jump right to a
header entry for a function or constant or macro or whatever."


<a name="fli-structures"></a>
<h4>FLI Data Structures</h4>

I usually define the structure and a typedef for it:

<p><code><pre>
; PAINTSTRUCT
(fli:define-c-struct sPAINTSTRUCT
  (HDC hdc)
  (fErase bool)
  (rcPaint-x uint)
  (rcPaint-y uint)
  (rcPaint-width uint)
  (rcPaint-height uint)
  (fRestore bool)
  (fIncUpdate bool)
  (rgbReserved (:c-array wBYTE 32)))
(fli:define-c-typedef PAINTSTRUCT sPAINTSTRUCT)
</pre></code>

<br>and then can do something like:

<p><code><pre>
(fli:with-dynamic-foreign-objects ()
  (let ((ps-ptr (fli:allocate-dynamic-foreign-object :type 'paintstruct)))
    (format t "~&Pointer value: ~a" (fli:pointer-address ps-ptr))))
</pre></code>

<br>although I'm not clear on why the typedef is valuable.  Lisp is
not C and in Lisp the typedef does not save me from typing
<code>struct sPAINTSTRUCT</code>, for example. I think the typedefs
are superfluous and I probably will stop using them.



<a name="fli-functions"></a>
<h4>FLI Functions</h4>

It is very easy to define OS calls in the FLI.  I start with the API
definition in the OS documentation. If Visual C++ is available, the
MSDN documentation is probably loaded on the machine. The
documentation is available on the <a
href="http://msdn.microsoft.com">MSDN website</a>. I go to the Win32
documentation page for the desired function and do a simple
translation:

<p><code><pre>
; LoadCursor
(fli:define-foreign-function 
    (LoadCursor "LoadCursor" :dbcs :calling-convention :stdcall)
    ((hInstance handle) (param ulong))
  :result-type handle)
</pre></code>

<p>All the Win32 calls I've seen so far are
<code>:calling-convention :stdcall</code>. If I know the function
includes a text parameter, I include the :dbcs keyword. If I don't
know, I try it without :dbcs. The actual function called in this
example is <code>LoadCursorA</code> or <code>LoadCursorW</code>.


<a name="callbacks"></a>
<h3>Callbacks from Windows to Lisp</h3>

Once the message pump is up and going, the OS delivers the messages by
calling a Lisp function repeatedly.  Lisp functions callable from the
foreign environment can be defined in the following manner:

<p><code><pre>
; WndProc -- Window procedure for the window we will create
(fli:define-foreign-callable 
    (wndproc :result-type :long :calling-convention :stdcall)
    ((hwnd hwnd) (msg ulong) 
     (wparam ulong) (lparam ulong))
  (case msg 
   (#.WM_PAINT (wndproc-paint hwnd msg wparam lparam))
   #+console (#.WM_DESTROY (PostQuitMessage 0) 0)
   (t (DefWindowProc hwnd msg wparam lparam))))
</pre></code>

<p>This wndproc function is the message dispatcher.  The OS calls
wndproc once for every message sent to the program. Wndproc is
responsible for understanding the message and calling the appropriate
function. 

<p>The #. reader macro returns the value of <code>WM_PAINT</code> and
<code>WM_DESTROY</code> at compile-time, allowing <code>case</code> to
work. #+console means "include the next form only if :console is a
member of *features*".  

<p>The example Win32 Lisp program in Appendix A
may be run either from the Lispworks IDE or from console mode, such as
ILISP in Emacs.  If <code>PostQuitMessage</code> is called from the
IDE, the IDE shuts down. If <code>PostQuitMessage</code> is not called
in console mode, the Win32 window does not close.

<h3>Starting the Program</h3>

Multiprocessing is always running under the Lispworks IDE but may or
may not be running using ILISP under Emacs.  Using multiprocessing is
great because one can peek and poke at the program and its variables,
provide new or redefined functions which take effect immediately, and
even make Win32 API calls, all while the program is running and the
window is visible with all its buttons and menus active.

<p>Using multiprocessing has not proven so nice for me under ILISP. I
love the ILISP and Emacs environment.  The Lispworks IDE is very nice,
and I keep a copy of it going for certain tasks such as finding online
manuals and using debug tools such as the inspector.  For editing and
most running, though, I prefer Emacs and ILISP. However, I have not
learned how to view multiple processes under ILISP, nor do I know how
to switch between them.  When I use multiprocessing with ILISP, it
appears to me that any thread with a condition grabs *standard-output*
and *standard-input*.  I don't know how to switch back to the other
thread.  This is enough of a problem that I don't use multiprocessing
under ILISP and when I need or want the interactive debug capabilities
possible with multiprocessing, or need multiprocessing in any form, I
switch to the Lispworks IDE.

<p>When running under the IDE, Lispworks provides the message pump.
When running under Emacs/ILISP (or in console mode, as would happen in
a delivered application), the Lisp program itself must provide the
message pump.  

<p>Thus in the example program in Appendix A, the function
<code>create-toplevel-window</code> ensures multiprocessing is running
when in console mode. The function
<code>create-toplevel-window-run</code> performs the message pump
operation in console mode but not otherwise. 

<p>The program in Appendix A makes a call to register-class when the file is
loaded. The call needs to be made only once and so I make the call
at the top-level:

<p><code><pre>
(defvar *reg-class-atom* (register-class))
</pre></code>

<p><code>create-toplevel-window-run</code> then only needs to call
<code>CreateWindowEx</code> and optionally start the message pump.

<h3>The Lisp REPL and Win32 Development</h3>

When a Win32 application is running from within the Lispworks IDE,
one is able to enter Lisp forms at the IDE's REPL prompt.  One can
view any variable, redefine any function, and make calls to
<code>SendMessage</code> or any other Win32 function that doesn't
require context from the OS, such as being within a WM_PAINT.  If one
redefines the function called when a button is clicked, the next click
of the button gets the new function. The Lispworks debug tools are
available. Other Lisp programs can be run simultaneously.  Individual
functions within the running Win32 program can be called from the
REPL. Functions can be traced and untraced, advice can be added or
removed, and CLOS classes can be redefined on the fly with Lisp
guaranteeing that the slot additions or deletions happen in an orderly
fashion within the running program.

<p>Lisp is designed to allow programs to run for years at a time, with
careful management, and to allow the programs to be maintained, with
bugs fixed, new functions defined, and CLOS objects redefined, during
that time.


<a name="capi"></a>
<h3>Making Direct Win32 Calls from CAPI</h3>

Lispworks includes CAPI, a cross-platform API for GUI program
development.  CAPI is powerful and easy to use.  For true
cross-platform capability, it is important to stay with 100%-pure CAPI.

<p>However, even in a pure Win32 environment it is reasonable to want
to use CAPI's features quickly to generate advanced GUI programs
without having to recreate every wheel.  It is possible to use
Win32-specific features from within a CAPI program.

<p><code><pre>
(defclass image-pane (output-pane) ()
   (:default-initargs
    :display-callback 'draw-image))

...

(let ((pane-1 (make-instance 'image-pane))
   ...
   (contain (make-instance 'column-layout
              :description (list pane-1 other-pane))
     :best-width 640
     :best-height 480)))

...

(defun draw-image (pane x y width height)
  (let ((hwnd (slot-value (capi-internals:representation pane) 'win32:hwnd)))
       ;; Now call CreateWindowEx with hwnd as the new window's parent
       ;; The Win32-defined window then covers the
       ;; CAPI window. After destroying or hiding the Win32 window, the
       ;; CAPI window is revealed.
       ;; Be careful not to create the window if it already is created.

....
</pre></code>

<p>(This uses capi-internals and may break in a future version of
CAPI.)  

<p>Note the connection from image-pane to pane-1, from image-pane to
draw-image, and that pane-1 is contained in the CAPI window.
Draw-image gets called when it is time to ... well, when it is time to
draw the image!

<p>Certainly calls to Win32 functions which don't require handles to
windows or other interaction with the CAPI environment work just fine.

<p>Many good programs use primarily local variables.  If one wishes to
use the multiprocessing environment to operate upon the program from
the Lispworks IDE while the Windows program is running, it is
important to have access to symbols and variables for the window
handles and other Windows resources.  If <code>SendMessage</code> is
to be called from the REPL, a valid hwnd must be available.  A way to
have the hwnd available is to do a setf from within a function to
which the OS passes the hwnd. This may be used as a debug-only
technique or left as a permanent part of the program.


<a name="cinterface"></a>
<h3>Interfacing to C</h3>

The OS makes many of the Win32 functions available always. Other
functions, for example the <code>avicap32</code> video functions, exist in
DLLs which must be explicitly loaded.  Third-party or custom-built
DLLs also require explicit loading.

<p>Make a def file, such as avicap32.def, named after the desired DLL: 

<p><code><pre>
exports capCreateCaptureWindow=capCreateCaptureWindowW
exports capGetDriverDescription=capGetDriverDescriptionW
</pre></code>

and in Lisp

<p><code><pre>
;; capCreateCaptureWindow
(fli:define-foreign-function
    (capCreateCaptureWindow "capCreateCaptureWindowW")
    ((lpszWindowName :pointer) (dwStyle fli-dword) (x :int) (y :int)
     (nWidth :int) (nHeight :int) (HWND fli-hwnd) (nID :int))
  :result-type (:unsigned :long)
  :module :avicap32
  :documentation "Opens a video capture window.")

(fli:register-module "avicap32")
</pre></code>

<p>Windows created using functions in DLLs can be given a CAPI
window as a parent, as previously shown.  The def file may
or may not be required, depending upon what functions are
desired. Maybe :dbcs should be used here, eliminating the need for the
hard-coded 'W' in the foreign function name.


<a name="raiiandgc"></a>
<h3>RAII and GC</h3>

A common C++ idiom is "Resource Acquisition Is Initialization", in
which a C++ object acquires an operating system resource, perhaps an
open file, in the constructor and releases the resource in the
object's destructor. These objects may have dynamic or indefinite
extent.  

<p>Objects with dynamic extent are declared local at the
beginning of a C++ function and the object's destructor is called when
the function returns and the object goes out of scope. The
corresponding Lisp idiom is the use of a <code>with-...</code>
macro. The macro is responsible for acquiring the resource and
releasing it under an unwind-protect.

<p>In C++, objects with indefinite extent must have their destructor
called explicity, with <code>delete</code> or <code>delete []</code>.
The destructor tears down the object, first releasing any acquired
resources via explicitly-programmed C++ code, then releasing the
object's memory via compiler-generated code as the destructor exits. 

<p>Lisp is garbage collected, which means that Lisp is responsible for
freeing the object's memory. However, that may not happen for a very
long time after the last reference to the object has disappeared.  The
garbage collector runs only as memory fills or when it is explicity
called.  If an object holds an acquired resource, almost always there
is a proper time to release the resource and not releasing it at
that time leads to resource exhaustion.

<p>Lisp is not responsible for acquired resources, such as window
handles, which the programmer acquired with explicit Lisp code.  The
programmer must define a function, something like <code>(defun
release-resources...</code>, and call the release function at the
point where the destructor would have been called in C++.  After the
release function returns and there are no references to the object,
Lisp will free the object's memory during a future garbage collection.

<p>Another issue with the Win32/Lisp environment concerns the GC,
which is free to move Lisp data. One cannot give the OS the address of
Lisp data which may be moved by the GC.  Any data given to the OS
should be allocated through the FLI, which is responsible for making
the data immovable.

<h3>COM</h3>

COM is widely used in Windows programming. Lispworks for Windows
includes a <i>COM/Automation User Guide and Reference Manual</i> and
the associated functions. I have not played with COM under Lisp and
only note the availability of the manuals and functions.  Actually, I
did require com and automation and called the com:midl form, which
loaded a huge series of IDL files, amazing in breadth and extent.  I
didn't actually make things happen with COM, though.


<a name="power"></a>
<h3>Beginning to Use the Power of Lisp</h3>

My first thought, when I finally completed my demo program, was "That
looks like any other Win32 program."  There was nothing Lispy about
it.  It was just Win32 code, programmable in any language.  Different
languages are good for different problem sets. When I think of Perl, I
think of text. I think of numbers along with Fortran. When I think of
Lisp, I think of defining my own language.  Macros are one of the
tools used to define embedded languages within Lisp and are part of
what makes Lisp the programmable programming language.

<p>Win32 API programming cries out for new languages.  It is a
very powerful and flexible API but in a given application context,
only certain subsets are used and they are used in repetitive
fashions.  This does not mean that the APIs should be redefined, were
that possible.  What works for one application may not work for the
next.  There probably are some language extensions that will be used
in nearly all Win32 programs.  Other extensions will apply only to
certain applications.

<p>One beauty of Lisp is that the programmer can define a new
extension at any time.  See <a href="macros.html">the Common Lisp
Cookbook's chapter on macros</a>.  I also recommend Paul Graham's <a
href="www.paulgraham.com/books.html">On Lisp</a> for learning to write
macros and a whole lot more.

<p>When writing code, notice when the same pattern is typed over and
over.  Then think, sooner rather than later, "it's time for a macro or
a function."  Notice the repetitive coding even when you're writing
macros. Macros can be built upon macros, and macros can generate
macros. 

<p>Knowing whether to choose a macro or a function is partly a
function of code bloat.  Macros are evaluated in place and cause new
code to be created, where functions do not.  The advantage of macros
is that they can create closures, capturing variable values present in
the environment when the macro is expanded, thus eliminating much of
the need for simple objects. If the macro creates <code>defvar</code>
or <code>defparameter</code> forms, other functions the macro creates
can use those vars and parameters, although closures can also be used
for that purpose. The use of defvars allows reference to those defvars
at the REPL in a multiprocessing environment while the Win32 program
has an open window and is executing.  Whether defvars or closures are
used, absolutely zero store-and-retrieve infrastructure is needed.

<p>If macros are not used in this way, then functions that would have
been created by the macro must have some form of object look-up code
to retrieve window handles, captions, and other resources specific to
the object in question.

<p>Be aware that functions can be declaimed inline and can be passed
as parameters, while macros cannot.  

<p>Many of the macros defined in <a
href="www.paulgraham.com/books.html">On Lisp</a> are very useful in
Win32 programming. I use the symbol creation macros extensively.

<p>One set of needed macros make using the Foreign Language Interface
easier, more compact, and more readable. I have a macro
<code>with-foreign-strings</code> which takes a list of
pointer-name/string pairs and creates a nested series of
<code>(fli:with-foreign-string...</code> calls, including creation of
the element-count and byte-count parameters with unique, predictible
names for each string. My <code>setf-foreign-slot-values</code>, and
<code>with-foreign-slot-values</code> macros also make for more
compact and readable code.

<p>Another set of macros is useful for defining the Windows message
handler functions.  I prefer to create a CLOS class for windows
messages and let the CLOS method dispatcher find the proper function
for each message.  This allows message handlers to be inherited and
more-specific handlers defined for selected messages in the derived
class.  CLOS handles this nicely.  I have a <code>DefMsgHandler</code>
macro that calls RegisterClass, defines the CLOS method for each
message to be handled, takes care of necessary housekeeping in
ubiquitous functions such as <code>WM_PAINT</code>, and allows easy
definition of function bodies to be executed for each desired type of
message. Other macros are useful for defining pushbuttons, edit boxes,
list views, and other Win32 controls.

<p>Look at <a href="#appendixb">Appendix B</a>. Compare it to <a
href="#appendixa">Appendix A</a>.  Of course, an extended version of
the header-file portion of Appendix A is used in Appendix B but not
shown there. All but a little of the program in Appendix A has been
reduced to a library which is invoked in Appendix B.  All of the
application-specific information is contained in the very small
program in Appendix B.

<p>The program in <a href="#appendixc">Appendix C</a> uses these
macros to define a window including radio buttons, pushbuttons, a
check box, text drawn on the background window, and a listview with
columns.


<a name="conclusion"></a>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

The example code presented in the text and in appendicies A-C places
an emphasis on staying in Lisp and accessing the Win32 API from
there. Paul Tarvydas has code in <a href="#appendixd">Appendix D</a>
which demonstrates cooperation and interaction between C and Lisp.  In
Paul's well-documented example, a C dll is used to drive the message
loop.  The Lisp callback function's address is placed from within Lisp
into a variable in the dll.

<p>Lisp provides an interactive and rich programming environment. The
judicious use of macros to create language extensions in Lisp
concentrates application-specific information into small local areas
of the overall system.  This simplifies the effort of understanding
the application, increases the reliability of the application, reduces
maintenance time, and increases the reliability of maintenance
changes.  Lisp is designed to make this easy.

<h3>Appendix D:  Paul Tarvydas's Example</h3>


<code><pre>
Here's an example that creates a windows class (in C) and gets invoked and 
handled from LWW.  It is similar to the "Hello" example in Petzhold, except 
that it hooks to the LWW mainloop instead of creating its own.  Probably it 
ain't as pretty as it might be, due to my rustiness with Win32 (and my lack 
of patience with it :-).

To use:

1) create a DevStudio Win32 DLL project called "wintest"
2) put the wintest.c file into the project
3) copy the run.lisp file into the project directory (so that the Debug
    directory is a subdirectory)
4) Build the C project.
5) Set Project>>Settings>>Debug>>Executable for debug session to point 
to the 
lispworksxxx.exe.
6) Run the project - this should bring up lispworks.
7) Open run.lisp, compile and load it.
8) In the listener, type "(run)".
9) You should then see a window with "hello" in the middle of it.

The example window class is built and initialized in C (called from the lisp 
mainline).  The windows callbacks to this window are handled in lisp (eg. the 
WM_PAINT message) - windows has been given a pointer to a lisp function 
(Lisp_WndProc) and has been told to use it for callbacks.  The lisp code 
makes direct Win32 calls that display the "hello" text.  Lisp uses FLI 
foreign functions and foreign variables to set this up.  [If one were doing 
this on a real project, a less contrived flow of control would be chosen, but 
this one appears to exercise the FLI calls that you were asking about].

[I welcome comments from anyone, re. style, simplification, etc.]

// Example of creating a windows class in
// a DLL, then invoking it from Lisp.
//
// Convention for this example - routines
// that are written in C and are called by
// lisp are prefixed by "C_" and routines
// written in lisp called by C are prefixed
// by "Lisp_".  Note that, using LWW's FLI functions
// and declarations everything could be done in Lisp.
// This example shows how to bounce between Lisp and
// C in the event that one might wish to "reuse"
// existing C code.

//
// The routines C_CreateClass and C_CreateWindow are
// written in C and exported from the DLL to be called
// by Lisp.  Note that routines exported from a DLL
// are expected to use the :stdcall calling convention.
//
// The routine Lisp_WndProc is written in Lisp and
// exported (via FLI) so that it may be called
// by Windows.  Note that Windows expects Lisp_WndProc
// to use the :stdcall calling convention.

// Windows calls a WndProc function to deliver a windows
// event to a widget.  In this example, this callback
// function is written in lisp.  If the WndProc function
// decides to handle the event, it should return 0, else
// it should call DefWindowProc.
//
// To get at the function, C uses a function pointer.
// Lisp must set this function pointer before calling
// C_CreateClass.  This variable is exported from
// the dll, allowing lisp to see it and to put a value
// into it.  
//
// [Obviously, we could do this in other ways, for
// example, we could pass the pointer to C_CreateClass as 
// a parameter.  Choosing to use a pointer variable shows
// off more of the FLI - the fact that lisp can manipulate
// C variables which reside in the DLL itself.]
