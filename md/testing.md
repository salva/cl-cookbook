So you want to easily test the code your writing? The following recipes
cover how to write automated tests. We will use an established and
well-designed regression testing framework called 'RT'. In the last
recipe we will discuss other options.

### Install RT

You can learn more about Dr. Richard C. Waters' [RT on
CLiki](http://www.cliki.net/RT). We will get up and running quickly, by
doing a standard asdf-install which will pull down Kevin Rosenburg's
packaged version. **Note: sbcl users can simply use sb-rt which is
prebundled with their system**.

    ;; Install rt from cliki 
    (asdf-install:install :rt)

This command downloads and installs the RT package. This step only needs
to be done once. If you just did the install then you can skip the next
step.

    (asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op :rt)

This line loads the RT package into your Lisp image.

### Write a Test

Normally we would be writing tests against our own code, but for clarity
let's write some tests against operations from the [String
recipes](strings.html#substrings) sections.

    ; using *my-string* from the substrings recipe "Groucho Marx"
    (rt:deftest test-subseq-one-index (subseq *my-string* 8) "Marx")
    TEST-SUBSEQ-ONE-INDEX

That substring recipe told us that we could expect "Marx" if we ask for
substring to 8. We use the deftest macro, naming our test
`test-subseq-one-index`. In the body of the test we specify the code we
want to test, followed by the expected results. The code
`(subseq *my-string* 8)`is evaluated and the number of values return
must match the number of expected results. In this example their is only
one value returned and it matches the one expected value `"Marx"`. For
each actual, expected pair, they must be **`EQUAL`**. Note that the REPL
prints the test name and under the covers this test is added to the
current test suite.

### Run a Test

We have defined a test, let's run it.

    CL-USER> (rt:do-test 'test-subseq-one-index)
    TEST-SUBSEQ-ONE-INDEX

We have RT test our assertion for how `SUBSEQ` should behave. The test
passes, so no errors are reported. do-test simply returns the name of
the test. In the next example we will see how RT behaves with failing
tests.

Tests can be run one at a time with `DO-TEST` as you incrementally build
up your system, or they can be run all at once with `DO-TESTS`. For our
second test, let's define and run a failing test.

    CL-USER> (rt:deftest test-subseq-two-indicies (subseq *my-string* 0 7) "Xroucho")
    TEST-SUBSEQ-TWO-INDICIES
    CL-USER> (rt:do-test 'test-subseq-two-indicies)
    Test TEST-SUBSEQ-TWO-INDICIES failed
    Form: (SUBSEQ *MY-STRING* 0 7)
    Expected value: "Xroucho"
    Actual value: "Groucho".
    NIL

We purposely provide an expected value which is wrong, so that the test
will fail. Notice RT describes a failed test to standard output. Also
the `DO-TEST` function returns `NIL` instead of the test as before.

The great value of test code is running it automatically and frequently
to find issues early in development. RT provides the `DO-TESTS` function
to regress all of the tests.

    CL-USER> (rt:do-tests)
    Doing 2 pending tests of 2 tests total.
     TEST-SUBSEQ-ONE-INDEX
    Test TEST-SUBSEQ-TWO-INDICIES failed                                                                                                                          
    Form: (SUBSEQ *MY-STRING* 0 7)
    Expected value: "Xroucho"
    Actual value: "Groucho".
    1 out of 2 total tests failed: TEST-SUBSEQ-TWO-INDICIES.
    NIL

Let's redefine `test-subseq-two-indicies` with a passing expected value.
Additionally let's define a third test.

    CL-USER> (rt:deftest test-subseq-two-indicies (subseq *my-string* 0 7) "Groucho")
    WARNING: Redefining test TEST-SUBSEQ-TWO-INDICIES
    TEST-SUBSEQ-TWO-INDICIES
    (rt:deftest test-concatenate-three-strings 
             (concatenate 'string "Karl" " " "Marx") "Karl Marx")
    TEST-CONCATENATE-THREE-STRINGS
    CL-USER> (rt:do-tests)
    Doing 3 pending tests of 3 tests total.
     TEST-SUBSEQ-ONE-INDEX TEST-SUBSEQ-TWO-INDICIES
     TEST-CONCATENATE-THREE-STRINGS
    No tests failed.
    T

Note that `DO-TESTS` picks up our third test
`test-concatenate-three-strings` because it runs the entire test suite
and prints a report to standard out that no tests have failed. The value
`T` is returned to signal a successful test run.

### RT Odds and Ends

If we pretend for a moment that `SUBSEQ` and `CONCATENATE` are Lisp
operations which we have written, you can see how easy it is to build up
a collection of tests to exercise and regress code as we write and
maintain it.

If you like using RT so far, you will want to read up on the
documentation which comes with it, or read the [original
paper](http://www.merl.com/publications/TR1991-004/) from 1991 which
covers RT and COVER (a code coverage framework). At a minimum you will
want to add

    (rem-all-tests)

to the beginning of your test code for the current project. You can use
`CONTINUE-TESTING` to run all of the tests which have either failed, or
are newly defined.

### Other Test Frameworks

Test Driven Development, xUnit testing frameworks, Automated Acceptance
Tests, etc are quite the rage in some areas of contemporary programming.
If RT doesn't fit your needs, or you would like to see what else is out
there, please see the following:

-   [CLiki Test Frameworks](http://www.cliki.net/test%20framework)
-   [ALU Wiki Test Frameworks](http://wiki.alu.org/Test_Frameworks)
-   [Unit Testing](http://www.cl-user.net/asp/tags/unit-testing) on The
    Common Lisp Directory

and one of many which is a good choice to look at is:
