# Using Emacs as a Lisp IDE

*** Obsolete: you want SLIME now! ***

*** Remove me? maybe this doesn't belongs to a cookbook ***


---

The material on this page was originally presented at the [ILC 2003
conference](http://www.international-lisp-conference.org/index.html). A
paper with more in-depth coverage of some of the material on this page
can be found on [Bill Clementson's
ILC2003](http://home.comcast.net/~b.clementson/ilc_2003.htm) page.

This page is meant to provide an introduction to using Emacs as a Lisp
IDE. The key bindings used in the example code snippets assume an Emacs
configuration similar to that provided by the
[.emacs](http://cl-cookbook.sourceforge.net/.emacs) file that is
included as part of the [Setting up an IDE with Emacs on Windows or Mac
OS X](http://cl-cookbook.sourceforge.net/windows.html) page. If you use
ILISP, the key bindings reflect the bindings that are present in the
current CVS version of ILISP.

Why Use Emacs?
--------------

-   Emacs has fantastic support for working with Lisp code
-   Not tying yourself into a single CL vendor's editor
-   Runs on virtually every OS and CL implementation
-   Extensible
-   Can be customized to do many common tasks
-   Built-in support for different source code version control systems
-   Vast number of add-on packages
-   Emacs will probably always be around
-   Emacs works well either with a mouse or without a mouse
-   Emacs has a large user base with multiple newsgroups
-   Benefits of using Emacs far outweigh the effort spent in learning it

Emacs Lisp vs Common Lisp
-------------------------

-   Learning Emacs Lisp is useful and similar (but different from CL):
    -   Dynamic scope is everywhere

    -   No package system

    -   There are no reader (or reader-related) functions

    -   Does not support all the types that are supported in CL

    -   Incomplete implementation of CLOS (with the add-on EIEIO
        package)

    -   Not all of CL is supported

    -   No numerical tower support

-   Some good Emacs Lisp learning resources:

    -   [An Introduction to Programming in Emacs
        Lisp](http://www.gnu.org/manual/emacs-lisp-intro/emacs-lisp-intro.html)

    -   [Writing GNU Emacs
        Extensions](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/gnuext/)

Lisp Modes in Emacs
-------------------

-   There are 4 different alternative major modes to use for CL
    programming:
    -   Inferior Lisp Mode

    -   [ILISP](http://sourceforge.net/projects/ilisp/)

    -   [ELI](http://www.franz.com/)

    -   [SLIME](http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/)

Lisp Modes in Emacs - Inferior Lisp Mode
----------------------------------------

-   Pros:
    -   Comes with Emacs

    -   Fast start-up, easy setup

    -   Supports many Lisp implementations

-   Cons:
    -   Limited functionality (compared to ILISP and ELI)

    -   No multiprocessing support

    -   Some conflicts with comint mode

-   Setup:
    -   Included with Emacs, so no separate installation required

Lisp Modes in Emacs - ILISP
---------------------------

-   Pros:
    -   Vastly superior to Inferior Lisp Mode in functionality

    -   Supports many Lisp implementations

-   Cons:
    -   No multiprocessing support

    -   Some conflicts with comint mode

-   Setup:
    -   A basic installation involves downloading the ILISP package from
        the web building it and configuring it

    -   Customization can be complex, useful to use instructions on [CL
        Cookbook](http://cl-cookbook.sourceforge.net/windows.html) to
        get started

Lisp Modes in Emacs - ELI (Emacs-Lisp Interface)
------------------------------------------------

-   Pros:
    -   Supports multiprocessing (this is a big pro)

    -   Has commands that allow you to work with changed definitions

    -   Standard, consistent set of options for managing output

    -   Support for ACL and support from Franz is very good

-   Cons:
    -   For CMUCL and SBCL, only limited functionality is available

    -   No built-in support for accessing either Franz or CL
        documentation

-   Setup:
    -   Basic ELI setup is very straight-forward for ACL

Lisp Modes in Emacs - Which One to Choose?
------------------------------------------

-   My Recommendation:
    -   Inferior Lisp Mode for casual CL programming only

    -   ELI if you use ACL

    -   SLIME otherwise

Working with Lisp Code
----------------------

-   Lisp Editing

-   Evaluating and Compiling Lisp

-   Searching Lisp Code

-   Note: Example code assumes you are using a setup similar to what is
    defined in the [.emacs
    file](http://cl-cookbook.sourceforge.net/.emacs)from the [CL
    Cookbook](http://cl-cookbook.sourceforge.net/windows.html) site

Working with Lisp Code - Editing
--------------------------------

-   Forward/Backward/Up/Down movement and selection by s-expressions (
    [s1.lisp](s1.lisp) )

<!-- -->

    ;; Put the cursor on the open parens of "(defvar.." and press "C-M-f"
        ;; and "C-M-b" a few times to see how you move in units of sexps. Put
        ;; the cursor on the second additon in the "(progn" statement and
        ;; press "C-M-t" to swap the first addition sexp and the second
        ;; one. Put the cursor on the open parens of "(+ x" in defun c and
        ;; press "C-M-@" to highlight the entire sexp. Then press "C-M-u" to
        ;; expand the selection "upwards" to the enclosing "(let". Pressing
        ;; "C-M-d" moves to the next enclosed sexp or (if you are at the
        ;; beginning of a line) to the enclosed sexp on the line: 

        (defvar a "a variable")

        (defun b ()
        "a function"
        (+ 2 2))

        (defun c ()
        "another function"
        (let ((x 42))
        (+ x
        (+ 2 2)
        (+ 3 3)
        (+ 4 4))))

        (progn
        (+ 1 1)
        (+ 2 2)
        (+ 3 3))
        

-   Deleting s-expressions ( [s2.lisp](s2.lisp) )

<!-- -->

    ;; Put the cursor on the open parens of "(progn .." and press "C-M-k"
        ;; to delete it. Then press "C-M-backspace" to delete the sexp before
        ;; the cursor:
      
      (defun d ()
      (if t  
      (+ 3 3)
      (progn
      (+ 1 1)
      (if t
      (+ 2 2)
      (+ 3 3)))
      (+ 4 4)))
        

-   Indenting s-expressions ( [s3.lisp](s3.lisp) )

<!-- -->

    ;; Put the cursor on the open parens of "(defun ..." and press "C-M-q"
        ;; to indent the code:
      
      (defun e ()
      "A badly indented function."
      (let ((x 20))
      (loop for i from 0 to x 
      do (loop for j from 0 below 10 
      do (print j)) 
      (if (< i 10)
      (let ((z nil) )
      (setq z (format t "x=~d" i))
      (print z))))))
        

    ;; This is the result:
      
      (defun e ()
      "A badly indented function."
      (let ((x 20))
      (loop for i from 0 to x 
      do (loop for j from 0 below 10 
      do (print j)) 
      (if (< i 10)
      (let ((z nil) )
      (setq z (format t "x=~d" i))
      (print z))))))
        

-   Support for parenthesis ( [s4.lisp](s4.lisp) )

<!-- -->

    ;; Placing the cursor on a "(" or after a ")" highlights the matching
        ;; parens:
      
      (progn (+ 3 3) (- 2 2))
        

    ;; A mismatched parens is highlighted in a different color (put cursor
        ;; after last parens and enter a ")" to see this:
      
      (- 2 2)
        

    ;; You can also type "M-x check-parens" to locate mismatched parens in
        ;; a buffer

    ;; Press "M-(" and you will get:

        () 
        ;; with the cursor placed on the closing parens, ready to enter the
        ;; function name. 

    ;; Put the cursor on the open parens of the "(+ 2 2)" sexp below and
        ;; press "C-u 2 M-(" to enclose the next 2 sexps with parens - then
        ;; type "+ 1" to add "1" to the result of the following 2 sexps:

        (progn (+ 2 2) (+ 3 3))
        

    ;; To delete the enclosing "progn" below, put the cursor on the open
        ;; parens of the "(+ 1 1)" and press the following sequence of keys:
        ;; "C-M-k C-M-k C-M-k C-M-u C-M-k C-y M-y C-M-a C-M-q":

        (defun a ()
        (progn 
        (+ 1 1)
        (+ 2 2)
        (+ 3 3)))
        

-   Automatic code indentation (CL vs Elisp) ( [s5.lisp](s5.lisp) )

<!-- -->

    ;; Indentation is automatic for Lisp forms. Example: Put the cursor
        ;; after the first addition form and press Enter:

        (progn
        (+ 3 3)
        (- 2 2))
        

    ;; Pressing TAB will indent incorrectly indented code. Example: Put
        ;; the cursor at the beginning of the "(+ 3 3)" form and press TAB:

        (progn
        (+ 3 3))
        

    ;; CL indentation rules are different from Emacs Lisp indentation
        ;; rules. Make certain you have the following code in a lisp mode hook
        ;; in your .emacs file:

        (set (make-local-variable lisp-indent-function)
        'common-lisp-indent-function)
        

-   Close all parenthesis ( [s6.lisp](s6.lisp) )

<!-- -->

    ;; Press "C-c ]" (in ELI) or "C-C C-v C-]" (in ILISP) to close all
        ;; parens. Example: Put cursor at end of following form and press the
        ;; appropriate key sequence:

        (progn (if nil (progn (+ 3 (- 2 1
        

-   Code completion ( [s7.lisp](s7.lisp) )

<!-- -->

    ;; Type the following and press "C-c TAB" (both ELI & ILISP) to get an
        ;; automatic completion for defvar:

        (defv
        

    ;; Typing in the following and pressing "C-c TAB" results in a list of
        ;; altermatives:

        (def
        

    ;; The Emacs hippie-expand command will expand both lisp symbols
        ;; (however, it only works off of lisp symbol information that is
        ;; either available in the buffers or a standard CL symbol) and
        ;; directories. For example, type in the following and press "C-c /"
        ;; to get a directory completion:

        (setq x "c:/pro
        

-   Hiding/showing code ( [s8.lisp](s8.lisp) )

<!-- -->

    ;; Highlight the middle "(if ..." block and press "C-x n n" to hide
        ;; everything but that block ("C-x n w" restores the other code):

        (if a 
        (+ 1 1))
        (if b
        (+ 2 2))
        (if c
        (+ 3 3))
        

    ;; Put the cursor on "(defun b ..." and press "C-x n d" to narrow to
        ;; just defun b (("C-x n w" restores the other code):

        (defun a ()
        (+ 1 1))

        (defun b ()
        (+ 2 2))

        (defun c ()
        (+ 3 3))
        

-   Comments ( [s9.lisp](s9.lisp) )

<!-- -->

    ;; Put the cursor on the following sexp and press "M-;" to get a
        ;; code line comment (right-hand comment):

        (setq x 1)
        

    ;; Highlight the 2nd & 3rd lines and press "M-;" to comment out those
        ;; lines (highlighting them a 2nd time and pressing "M-;" removes the
        ;; comment):

        (+ 1 1)
        (+ 2 2)
        (+ 3 3)
        

    ;; Using Paul Foley's comment functions allows you to selectively
        ;; comment out embedded sexps. Example: Put the cursor on the "(+ 4
        ;; 4)" sexp and press "C-c ;" to comment out that sexp. Pressing "C-c
        ;; ;" comments out the enclosing sexp (and on upwards). Pressing "C-c
        ;; :" removes the comment:

        (+ 1 (+ 2 (+ 3 (+ 4 4))))
        

    ;; Emacs knows how to wrap comment text intelligently. For example, this comment line spans
        ;; muliple lines but is not aligned consitently
        ;; with the rest of the comments/code in the file (everything else
        ;; ends at
        ;; column 68. Pressing "M-q" adjusts the comments appropriately.
        

Working with Lisp Code - Evaluating and Compiling Lisp
------------------------------------------------------

-   buffer

-   region

-   defun

-   sexp (previous/next)

-   DWIM

-   Example code ( [s11.lisp](s11.lisp) )

<!-- -->

    ;; Compile the entire buffer by pressing "C-c C-b" (ELI) or "C-c C-k
        ;; C-b" (ILISP).

        ;; Compile a region by selecting the first 2 forms in test-all and
        ;; pressing "C-c C-r" (ELI) or "C-c C-k C-r" (ILISP).

        ;; Compile a defun by putting the cursor inside the "test-format"
        ;; defun and pressing "C-c C-x" (ELI) or "C-c C-k C-d" (ILISP).

        ;; Compile the sexp before the point by putting the cursor after the
        ;; closing paren of "(test-format)" and pressing "C-c C-s" (ELI). 

        ;; As a general rule, to evaluate rather than compile, press "C-u"
        ;; before the ELI command (e.g. -- "C-u C-c C-s" to evaluate the sexp
        ;; before the point instead of "C-c C-s" to compile it) or enter the
        ;; ILISP key sequence with a "C-c C-j" prefix rather than a "C-c C-k"
        ;; prefix (e.g. -- use "C-c C-j C-d" to evaluate a defun instead of
        ;; "C-c C-k C-d" to compile the defun)

        ;; The "Do What I Mean" evaluation/compilation functions work on the
        ;; following basis: If a region is selected, process the region.  If
        ;; the cursor is on or immediately after a ')', process the last sexp.
        ;; If the cursor is on or immediately before a '(', process the next
        ;; sexp. If the cursor is inside a defun, process the defun. If the
        ;; cursor is inside a top-level sexp, process the top-level
        ;; sexp. Tests are done in the order specified, so (if there is any
        ;; ambiguity), make certain that the cursor is either on a parenthesis
        ;; (for the last/next commands or not directly before/after/on a
        ;; parenthesis for the defun/top-level commands.  Press "C-c d" (ELI)
        ;; or "C-c C-j C-j" (ILISP).

        (defun test (n)
        (loop for i from 0 below n
        do (print i)))

        (defun test-format ()
        (format t "This is a test.~%"))

        (defun test-format-loop (n)
        (loop for i from 0 below n
        do (test-format)
        (sleep 1)))

        (defun test-all ()
        (test 5)
        (test-format)
        (test-format-loop 5))
        

Working with Lisp Code - Searching Lisp Code
--------------------------------------------

-   Standard Emacs text search (isearch forward/backward, regexp
    searches, search/replace) ( [s12.lisp](s12.lisp) )

<!-- -->

    ;; "C-s" does an incremental search forward (e.g. - as each key is
        ;; the search string is entered, the source file is searched for the
        ;; first match. This can make finding specific text much quicker as
        ;; you only need to type in the unique characters. Repeat searches
        ;; (using the same search characters) can be done by repeatedly
        ;; pressing "C-s"

        ;; "C-r" does an incremental search backward

        ;; "C-s RET" and "C-r RET" both do conventional string searches
        ;; (forward and backward respectively)

        ;; "C-M-s" and "C-M-r" both do regular expression searches (forward
        ;; and backward respectively)

        ;; "M-%" does a search/replace while "C-M-%" does a regular
        ;; expression search/replace

-   Finding occurances (occur, grep) ( [s13.lisp](s13.lisp) )

<!-- -->

    ;; Use the Emacs "occur" function to find all occurances of a string
        ;; (or regexp) in a buffer. Example: Enter "M-x occur" and enter the
        ;; string "defun" to get a list of all the occurances of the
        ;; characters "defun" in the current buffer.

        (defvar aa "a" "a variable")

        (defmacro d (x)
        "a macro"
        `(list ,x))
        

    ;; Use the Emacs "grep" function to find all occurances of a string
        ;; (or regexp) in a multiple files. Example: Enter "M-x grep" and
        ;; enter the string "defun *.lisp" to get a list of all the function
        ;; definitions in lisp files in the current directory.

        (setq x aa)
        

-   Lisp symbols in multiple source files (etags) ( [s16.lisp](s16.lisp)
    )

<!-- -->

    ;; Enter "M-x shell" to bring up a shell window in the current
        ;; directory. Then run "etags *.lisp" to create a TAG file containing

<!-- -->

    ;; With the cursor on the "let", press "C-c x" (ELI or ILISP) to
        ;; evaluate a lisp form by copying it into the listener.

    ;; In ILISP, most of the eval & compile functions have an "and go"
        ;; equivalent that transfers the focus to the listener after
        ;; execution. Their key bindings are the same as the normal
        ;; eval/compile functions except that the final key does not have a
        ;; "Ctrl" prefix. For example, put the cursor at the open paren of the
        ;; "(let ..." sexp above and press "C-c C-j C-n" to evaluate in the
        ;; source buffer. Then, press "C-c C-j n" to evaluate "and go" to the
        ;; listener.

Questions/Answers
-----------------

-   Q1. Controlling evaluation output

<!-- -->

    Q1 I get irritated by ELI's switching to an output buffer when I evaluate a sexp in a Lisp source
          buffer.  

    A1 You can control where ELI output goes to by setting the
          fi:pop-up-temp-window-behavior variable. Alternatively, you can use my copy-eval-dwim-lisp function (bound to
          "C-c x"). It copies Lisp code from the source buffer to the listener buffer and evaluates it there. Both
          buffers stay visible and focus remains in the source buffer. The code works for ILISP, ELI and Emacs
          Lisp.

-   Q2. Viewing HyperSpec from within Emacs

<!-- -->

    Q2 I like having access to the HyperSpec when I'm
          in Emacs, but why does it have to use an external browser? Why can't I just see the HyperSpec in Emacs?

    A2 If you use the Emacs add-on package W3 (or W3M which provides similar functionality), you can
          display HTML pages inside of Emacs. Once you have W3 and the HyperSpec both installed, use code similar to the
          following to access the HyperSpec from the Shift-F1 key:

    (global-set-key [(shift f1)]
          '(lambda ()
          (interactive)
          (let ((browse-url-browser-function 
          'browse-url-w3)
          (common-lisp-hyperspec-root            
          "file://c:/home/docs/Hyperspec/")
          (common-lisp-hyperspec-symbol-table 
          (concat common-lisp-hyperspec-root 
          "Data/Map_Sym.txt"))
          (hyperspec-prog 
          "c:/home/site/ilisp/extra/hyperspec"))
          (load-library hyperspec-prog)
          (common-lisp-hyperspec 
          (thing-at-point 'symbol)))))
          

    Note that the "let" in the above code sets the browse-url-browser-function to W3 for just the
          HyperSpec. You can either set the variable globally (if you want to always use W3 or some other specific browser)
          or locally (if you want to use a specific browser and not the default one).

-   Q3. Standard shell

<!-- -->

    Q3 I switch between UNIX® and Windows environments and, although
          Emacs makes this switch a lot easier, I find it inconvenient having to use different Shell environments on
          different operating systems.

    A3 On Windows, the Cygwin
          tools provide a lot of the same tools that are available under UNIX® as well as a BASH shell. Alternatively,
          you might want to consider using eshell, a shell written in Emacs Lisp that comes as a standard feature in later
          releases of Emacs. You can access eshell by pressing "F12".

-   Q4. Using ACL tools with Emacs

<!-- -->

    Q4 I would like to use Emacs with Franz's ACL but find
          that I use the Franz tools so much that I can't afford to not load their IDE.

    A4 It
          doesn't have to be an either/or decision. On Windows, Franz allows you to specify (under Options) that Emacs is to
          be the default editor in place of their built-in editor. On UNIX®, Emacs also works very well together with the
          Franz tools.

-   Q5. Windows-style cut/copy/paste

<!-- -->

    Q5 I want to use Emacs on a Windows
          machine. Unfortunately, I have the Windows cut/copy/paste key bindings burned into my fingertips and would find it
          very difficult to switch back and forth between the Windows standard for these shortcut keys and the Emacs
          standard.

    A5 Luckily, you don't have to! Download cua.el and you can continue to use the Windows
          defaults. In fact, you may find that the following commands in your .emacs file will make Emacs more
          Windows-like:

    ;; Windows-like mouse/arrow movement & selection (pc-selection-mode)
          (delete-selection-mode t)
          ;; C-z=Undo, C-c=Copy, C-x=Cut, C-v=Paste (needs cua.el)
          (require 'cua) (CUA-mode t) 

-   Q6. Simplified Emacs setup

<!-- -->

    Q6 There was a lot of Emacs Lisp code presented in this
          paper. Do I really have to type in all this stuff to get started with Emacs and Lisp?

    A6
          No, there is a sample .emacs file that can be used to get
          started. It contains all of the configurations that have been described in this page and (hopefully) should work
          with some minor tweaking. See the CL-Cookbook page on "Setting up an IDE with Emacs on Windows or Mac OS
          X".

-   Q7. Alternatives to Emacs for CL programming

<!-- -->

    Q7 I've tried out Emacs and I just can't get
          used to it. What other Lisp-friendly alternative are there?

    A7 The Franz, LispWorks, Corman, and Digitool commercial Lisp
          offerings all have Lisp-aware editors.

          CMUCL has Hemlock, which is also being adapted for other Lisps.

          XEmacs is an alternative to GNU Emacs that works with many of the same Elisp
          libraries. Some people prefer it to GNU Emacs.

          Vim can be used to edit Lisp code. An article by Larry Clapp gives some
          pointers on how to use Vim with Lisp.

          Jabberwocky is a Lisp editor/debugger written in Java.

          Lastly, for true masochists, notepad on Windows or ed on UNIX® can also be used. ;-)
