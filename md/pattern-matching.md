# Pattern Matching and Regular Expressions
==========================================

**Obsolete**

Include links to modern regular expression libraries

---

The [ANSI Common Lisp
standard](http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/index.html)
does not include facilities for pattern matching and regular
expressions, but a couple of libraries exist for this task. See the
respective [CLiki page](http://www.cliki.net/Regular Expression) for
details and links.

Note that some CL implementations include regexp facilities, notably
[CLISP](http://clisp.sourceforge.net/impnotes.html#regexp) and [Allegro
CL](http://www.franz.com/support/documentation/6.1/doc/regexp.htm). If
in doubt, check your manual or ask your vendor.
