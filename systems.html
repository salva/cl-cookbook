    <P>A <B>system</B> is a collection of Lisp files that together
    constitute an application or a library, and that should therefore
    be managed as a whole. A <b>system definition</b> describes which
    source files make up the system, what the dependencies among them
    are, and the order they should be compiled and loaded in. You can
    think of a system definition as an enhanced version of a Unix
    makefile, one that uses Lisp objects to define the systems instead
    of text files. Unfortunately, system definition is one of the
    areas that the CL ANSI standard does not address, and therefore
    almost every lisp version has its own version of a defsystem tool;
    they all have approximately the same functionality, but with
    slightly different syntax.</P>

    <A name="example"></A>
    <H3>An example</H3>
    <P>This example shows how to use the defsystem facility available
      in Allegro Common Lisp 6.x. Suppose you are working on an HTML
      generation library, that is composed of three files: "top.cl",
      that defines a package for this library, "html.cl" that
      implements the basic HTML-generating operations, and
      "library.cl" that defines high-level functions and macros to
      generate HTML pages. A system definition for your library might
      look like this:

      <PRE>

(defsystem :html
    (:pretty-name "HTML generation library"
     :default-pathname #P"/code/lisp/html/")
  (:serial "top"
           "html"
           "library"))
      </PRE>

    <P>The above form defines a system whose name is the symbol
      <code>:html</code>. After the system name comes a list
      containing optional information: in this case, we specified a
      human-readable name for the package, and the directory where the 
      source files are located. Finally, the three files that compose
      the system are listed, with the <code>:serial</code> keyword
      indicating that they should be compiled and loaded in the
      specified order (possibly because each one depends on
      definitions in the previous ones).</P>

    <P>Having defined a system like the above, you can then operate on 
      it. For example, calling:

    <PRE>

(load-system :html :compile t)

</PRE>
    
    will cause the three files in the system to be compiled (if
    needed) and loaded.</P>

    <P>Note that a system can include other systems as components, and 
      the included systems will be recursively compiled and
      loaded. For example, if we wanted the definitions in the
      <code>:util</code> system to be available to the
      <code>:html</code> system, we would change the above definition
      to:

      <PRE>

(defsystem :html
    (:pretty-name "HTML generation library"
     :default-pathname #P"/code/lisp/html/")
  (:serial :util
           "top"
           "html"
           "library"))
      </PRE>

    
    <A name="cross"></A>
    <H3>Cross-platform defsystems</H3> 

    <P>The most advanced attempt at building a cross-platform system
      definition tool is probably <b>MK-DEFSYSTEM</B>, available from 
      <A href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/clocc">CLOCC</A>. Please
      refer to that site for more details on how to install it and use
      it.</P>

    <A name="begin"></A>
    <H3>System construction for beginners</H3> 

    <P>Organizing a large Lisp system is not trivial: managing the
    interdependencies among a large number of source files and the
    interactions between multiple packages can easily turn into a
    complex undertaking that requires careful planning. Combine this
    with the fact that ANSI CL provides an alternative, although much
    more limited, way of managing code (<A
    href="http://www.xanalys.com/software_tools/reference/HyperSpec/Body/f_provid.htm"><code>PROVIDE</code></A>
    and <A
    href="http://www.xanalys.com/software_tools/reference/HyperSpec/Body/f_provid.htm"><code>REQUIRE</code></A>),
    and the whole issue can quickly become a nightmare for
    beginners. So here is a suggestion on a possible way to organize
    your code, one that works best for small, self-contained packages
    with a well-defined API, and that provide functions that might be
    useful to other parts of a larger program. Just follow these three
    easy steps...</P>

      <OL>
      <LI>Put the following in your Lisp initialization file:
	
	<pre>

(eval-when (:load-toplevel :execute)
  (shadow 'cl:require))

(defun require (system)
  (excl:load-system system :compile t)  ; *** ACL specific
  (unless (member system *modules*)
    (push system *modules*)
    (when (find-package system)
      (use-package system))))

</pre>

	The <code>LOAD-SYSTEM</code> call is specific to ACL's
	defsystem, so you should replace it with the equivalent call
	for the defsystem you are using.</LI><br>

    <LI>Write your code so that it creates its own package, and
      exports all public symbols from it. Using the <code>:html</code> 
	system defined above as an example:
<pre>

(defpackage :html
  (:use :lisp)
  (:export "ANCHOR" "HEADER" ...))
  </PRE>

 </LI><br>

    <LI>Write a system definition for your code, giving the system the
      same name you used for the package (like the
	<code>DEFSYSTEM</code> form for <code>:html</code> at the
	beginning of this chapter).</LI>
    </OL>
    
    <P>Now you can simply call 
<pre>

* (require :html)

</pre>

    and the system will be compiled (if needed) and loaded; moreover,
    all of its external symbols will be imported into the current
    package. If you later modify your code, you just have to call <A
    href="http://www.xanalys.com/software_tools/reference/HyperSpec/Body/f_provid.htm"><code>REQUIRE</code></A>
    again, and the system will be recompiled and reloaded. This
    behaves approximately like the <code>use</code> command in Perl or
    the <code>import</code> statement in Java: it allows you to easily
    access the functionality provided by a Lisp package with a single
    command.</P>
