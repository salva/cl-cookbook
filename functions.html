<h3>Functions that return functions</h3>

&quot;How do I write a function that returns a function?&quot; is a
typical question asked by people who have learned Scheme before they
started with Common Lisp. In Scheme, they were accustomed to be able
to do things like this:

<pre>
==> (define (adder n) (lambda (x) (+ x n)))
adder

==> ((adder 3) 5)
8

==> (define (doubler f) (lambda (x) (f x x)))
doubler

==> ((doubler +) 4)
8
</pre>

This can of course be done in Common Lisp, but the syntax and the semantics are
different. The first step, creating a function that returns a function,
looks very similar apart from minor syntactical conventions, but what
happens behind the scenes is different:

<pre>
* (defun adder (n)
    (lambda (x) (+ x n)))
ADDER
</pre>

Here we have defined the function <code>ADDER</code> which returns an <em>object</em> of
<em>type</em> <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/t_fn.htm"><code>FUNCTION</code></a>. To create such an
object you'll have to use the special operator <a
href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/s_fn.htm"><code>FUNCTION</code></a> and apply it to a <em>lambda expression</em>. <code>(FUNCTION <em>form</em>)</code>
may be abbreviated as <code>#'<em>form</em></code>. In our example
above we used a shorthand notation provided by the macro <a
href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/m_lambda.htm"><code>LAMBDA</code></a>. Without this little bit of syntactical
sugar we would have to write it as

<pre>
* (defun adder (n)
    #'(lambda (x) (+ x n)))
ADDER
</pre>

or

<pre>
* (defun adder (n)
    (function (lambda (x) (+ x n))))
ADDER
</pre>

No matter how we write it, <code>ADDER</code> will now return a
function whenever we call it. But we <em>can't</em> use it in the same
way we would use it in Scheme:

<pre>
;;; continued from above
* (adder 3)
#&lt;Interpreted Function "LAMBDA (N)" {485FFE81}&gt;

* ((adder 3) 5)
In: (ADDER 3) 5
  ((ADDER 3) 5)
Error: Illegal function call.
</pre>

Here is why: CL has different <em>namespaces</em> for
functions and variables, i.e. the same <em>name</em> can refer to
different things depending on it's position in a form that's
evaluated:

<pre>
* (boundp 'foo)
NIL
* (fboundp 'foo)
NIL
* (defparameter foo 42)
FOO
* foo
42
* (boundp 'foo)
T
* (fboundp 'foo)
NIL
* (defun foo (x) (* x x))
FOO
* (fboundp 'foo)
T
* foo            ;;; ***
42
* (foo 3)        ;;; +++
9
* (foo foo)
1764
* (function foo)
#&lt;Interpreted Function FOO {48523CC1}&gt;
* #'foo
#&lt;Interpreted Function FOO {48523CC1}&gt;
* (let ((+ 3))
    (+ + +))
6
</pre>

To simplify a bit, you can think of each symbol in CL having (at
least) two &quot;cells&quot; in which information is stored. One cell
- sometimes referred to as its <em>value cell</em> - can hold a value
that is <em>bound</em> to this symbol, and you can use <a
href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_boundp.htm"><code>BOUNDP</code></a> to test whether the symbol is bound to
a value (in the global environment).  You can access the value cell of
a symbol with <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_symb_5.htm"><code>SYMBOL-VALUE</code></a>.
<p>

The other cell - sometimes referred to as its <em>function cell</em> -
can hold the definition of the symbol's (global) function binding. In
this case, the symbol is said to be <em>fbound</em> to this
definition. You can use <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_fbound.htm"><code>FBOUNDP</code></a> to test
whether a symbol is fbound. You can access the function cell of a
symbol (in the global environment) with <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_symb_1.htm"><code>SYMBOL-FUNCTION</code></a>.
<p>

Now, if a <em>symbol</em> is evaluated, it is treated as a
<em>variable</em> in that it's value cell is returned - see the line
marked with <em>***</em> above. If a <em>compound form</em>, i.e. a
<em>cons</em>, is evaluated and its <em>car</em> is a symbol, then the
function cell of this symbol is used - see the line marked
<em>+++</em> above. 
<p>

In Common Lisp, as opposed to Scheme, it is <em>not</em> possible that
the car of the compound form to be evaluated is an arbitrary form. If
it is not a symbol, it <em>must</em> be a <em>lambda expression</em>, which looks
like

<pre>
(lambda <em>lambda-list</em> <em>form*</em>)
</pre>

This explains the error message we got above - <code>(ADDER 3)</code>
is neither a symbol nor a lambda expression. But, you might ask, how
<em>do</em> we use the function object that is returned by <code>ADDER</code>? The answer
is: Use <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_funcal.htm"><code>FUNCALL</code></a> or <a
href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_apply.htm"><code>APPLY</code></a>:

<pre>
;;; continued from above
* (funcall (adder 3) 5)
8
* (apply (adder 3) '(5))
8
* (defparameter *my-fun* (adder 3))
*MY-FUN*
* *my-fun*
#&lt;Interpreted Function "LAMBDA (N)" {486468C9}&gt;
* (funcall *my-fun* 5)
8
* (*my-fun* 5)
Warning: This function is undefined:
  *MY-FUN*
</pre>

Note that in the last example the function object returned by
<code>(ADDER 3)</code> is stored in the <em>value cell</em> of
<code>*MY-FUN*</code> - thus the error message. If we want to be able
to use the symbol <code>*MY-FUN*</code> in the car of a compound form,
we have to explicitely store something in its <em>function cell</em>
(which is normally done for us by the macro
<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/m_defun.htm"><code>DEFUN</code></a>):

<pre>
;;; continued from above
* (fboundp '*my-fun*)
NIL
* (setf (symbol-function '*my-fun*) (adder 3))
#&lt;Interpreted Function "LAMBDA (N)" {4869FA19}&gt;
* (fboundp '*my-fun*)
T
* (*my-fun* 5)
8
</pre>

Now we are ready do define <code>DOUBLER</code> as well:

<pre>
* (defun doubler (f)
    (lambda (x) (funcall f x x)))
DOUBLER
* (doubler #'+)
#&lt;Interpreted Function "LAMBDA (F)" {48675791}&gt;
* (doubler '+)
#&lt;Interpreted Function "LAMBDA (F)" {486761B1}&gt;
* (funcall (doubler #'+) 4)
8
* (funcall (doubler '+) 4)
8
* (defparameter *my-plus* '+)
*MY-PLUS*
* (funcall (doubler *my-plus*) 4)
8
* (defparameter *my-fun* (doubler '+))
*MY-FUN*
* (funcall *my-fun* 4)
8
</pre>

Note that the argument to <code>FUNCALL</code> (and
<code>APPLY</code>) can either be the function itself,
i.e. <code>#'+</code>, or a symbol which has the function in its
function cell (is fbound to the function), i.e. <code>'+</code>. 
<p>

All of the above is <em>extremely simplified</em> - we haven't even
mentioned macros, special forms, symbol macros, self-evaluating
objects, and lexical environments. Read the CLHS section about <a
href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/03_aba.htm">Form Evaluation</a> for the real deal.


<a name="curry"></a>
<h3>Currying functions</h3>

A related concept is that of
<a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~scott/pl/lectures/caml-intro.html#higherorder"><em>currying</em></a>
which you might be familiar with if you're coming from a functional
language. After we've read the last section that's rather easy to
implement: 

<pre>
* (declaim (ftype (function (function &rest t) function) curry)
           (inline curry))
NIL
* (defun curry (function &rest args)
    (lambda (&rest more-args)
      (apply function (append args more-args))))
CURRY
* (funcall (curry #'+ 3) 5)
8
* (funcall (curry #'+ 3) 6)
9
* (setf (symbol-function 'power-of-ten) (curry #'expt 10))
#<Interpreted Function "LAMBDA (FUNCTION &REST ARGS)" {482DB969}>
* (power-of-ten 3)
1000
</pre>

Note that the <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/m_declai.htm"><code>DECLAIM</code></a>
statement above is just a hint for the compiler so it can produce more
efficient code if it so wishes. Leaving it out won't change the
semantics of the function.
