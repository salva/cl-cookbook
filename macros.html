<p>The word <EM>macro</EM> is used generally in computer science to mean a
syntactic extension to a programming language.<font size=-1>[Note: The name
comes from the word "macro-instruction,'' which was a useful feature
of many second-generation assembly languages.  A macro-instruction
looked like a single instruction, but expanded into a sequence of
actual instructions.  The basic idea has since been used many times,
notably in the C preprocessor.  The name "macro'' is perhaps not
ideal, since it connotes nothing relevant to what it names, but we're
stuck with it.]</font> 
Although many languages have a macro facility, none of them
are as powerful as Lisp's.  The basic mechanism  of Lisp
macros is simple, but has subtle complexities, so 
learning your way around it takes a bit of practice.

<p>A macro is an ordinary piece of Lisp code that operates on <EM>another piece of putative Lisp code,</EM> translating it into (a version
closer to) executable Lisp.  That may sound a bit complicated, so
let's give a simple example.  Suppose you want a version of <SAMP>setq</SAMP>
that sets two variables to the same value.  So if you write

<p><pre>
   (setq2 x y (+ z 3))
</pre>

<p>when <SAMP>z</SAMP>=8 both <SAMP>x</SAMP> and <SAMP>y</SAMP> are set to 11.  (I can't
think of any use for this, but it's just an example.)

<p>It should be obvious that we can't define <SAMP>setq2</SAMP> as a function.
If <SAMP>x</SAMP>=50 and <SAMP>y</SAMP>=<i>-5</i>, this function would receive the values
50, <i>-5</i>, and 11; it would have no knowledge of what variables were
supposed to be set.  What we really want to say is, When you (the Lisp
system) see <SAMP>(setq2 <i>v<sub>1</sub></i> <i>v<sub>2</sub></i> <i>e</i>)</SAMP>, treat it as equivalent to 
<SAMP>(progn (setq <i>v<sub>1</sub></i> <i>e</i>) (setq <i>v<sub>2</sub></i> <i>e</i>))</SAMP>.  
Actually, this isn't
quite right, but it will do for now.  A macro allows us to do
precisely this, by specifying a program for transforming the input
pattern <SAMP>(setq2 <i>v<sub>1</sub></i> <i>v<sub>2</sub></i> <i>e</i>)</SAMP> into the output pattern <SAMP>(progn ...)</SAMP>.  

<p>Here's how we could define the <SAMP>setq2</SAMP> macro:
<pre>
(defmacro setq2 (v1 v2 e)
   (list 'progn (list 'setq v1 e) (list 'setq v2 e)))
</pre>
This is very close to the following function definition
<pre>
(defun setq2F (v1 v2 e)
   (list 'progn (list 'setq v1 e) (list 'setq v2 e)))
</pre>
If we evaluated <SAMP>(setq2F 'x 'y '(+ z 3))</SAMP>, we would get
<SAMP>(progn (setq x (+ z 3)) (setq y (+ z 3)))</SAMP>.  This is a perfectly
ordinary Lisp computation, whose sole point of interest is that its
output is a piece of executable Lisp code.  What <SAMP>defmacro</SAMP> does
is create this function implicitly and arrange that whenever an
expression of the form <SAMP>(setq2 x y (+ z 3))</SAMP> is seen, <SAMP>setq2F</SAMP>
is called with the pieces of the form as arguments, namely <SAMP>x</SAMP>,
<SAMP>y</SAMP>, and <SAMP>(+ z 3)</SAMP>.  The resulting piece of code then replaces
the call to <SAMP>setq2</SAMP>, and execution resumes as if the new piece of
code had occurred in the first place.  The macro form is said to <EM>expand</EM> into the new piece of code.

<p>This is all there is to it, except, of course, for the myriad subtle
consequences.  The main consequence is that <EM>run time for the <SAMP>setq2</SAMP> macro is compile time for its context.</EM>  That is, suppose the
Lisp system is compiling a function, and midway through it finds the
expression <SAMP>(setq2 x y (+ z 3))</SAMP>.  The job of the compiler is, of
course, to translate source code into something executable, such as
machine language or perhaps byte code.  Hence it doesn't
execute the source code, but operates on it in various mysterious
ways.  However, once the compiler sees the <SAMP>setq2</SAMP> expression, it
must suddenly switch to executing the body of the <SAMP>setq2</SAMP> macro.
As I said, this is an ordinary piece of Lisp code, which can in
principle do anything any other piece of Lisp code can do.  That means
that when the compiler is running, the entire Lisp (run-time) system
must be present.

<p>Novices often make the following sort of mistake.  Suppose that the
<SAMP>setq2</SAMP> macro needs to do some complex transformation on its <SAMP>e</SAMP> argument before plugging it into the result.  Suppose this
transformation can be written as a Lisp procedure <SAMP>comtran</SAMP>.  The
novice will often write:

<p><pre>
(defmacro setq2 (v1 v2 e)
   (let ((e1 (comtran e)))
      (list 'progn (list 'setq v1 e1) (list 'setq v2 e1))))

<p>(defmacro comtran (exp) ...) ;; <EM>Wrong!</EM>
</pre>

<p>The mistake is to suppose that once a macro is called, the Lisp system
enters a "macro world,'' so naturally everything in that world must
be defined using <SAMP>defmacro</SAMP>.  This is the wrong picture.  The
right picture is that <SAMP>defmacro</SAMP> enables a step into the <EM>ordinary Lisp world</EM>, but in which the principal object of
manipulation is Lisp code.  Once that step is taken, one uses ordinary
Lisp function definitions:

<p><pre>
(defmacro setq2 (v1 v2 e)
   (let ((e1 (comtran e)))
      (list 'progn (list 'setq v1 e1) (list 'setq v2 e1))))

<p>(defun comtran (exp) ...) ;; <EM>Right!</EM>
</pre>

<p>One possible explanation for this mistake may be that in other
languages, such as C, invoking a preprocessor macro <EM>does</EM> get you
into a different world; you can't run an arbitrary C program.  It
might be worth pausing to think about what it might mean to be able to.

<p>Another subtle consequence is that we must spell out how the arguments
to the macro get distributed to the hypothetical behind-the-scenes
function (called <SAMP>setq2F</SAMP> in my example).  In most cases, it is
easy to do so: In defining a macro, we use all the usual <SAMP>lambda</SAMP>-list syntax, such as <SAMP>&amp;optional</SAMP>, <SAMP>&amp;rest</SAMP>, <SAMP>&amp;key</SAMP>, but what gets bound to the formal parameters are pieces of the
macro form, not their values (which are mostly unknown, this being
compile time for the macro form).  So if we defined a macro thus:
<pre>
   (defmacro foo (x &amp;optional y &amp;key (cxt 'null)) ...)
</pre>
then 
<table>
<TR> <TD align=left> <EM>If we call it thus ...</EM> </TD> <TD align=left> <EM>The parameters' values are
...</EM> </TD></TR>
<TR> <TD align=left> <SAMP>(foo a)</SAMP> </TD> <TD align=left> <SAMP>x<i>=</i>a, y<i>=</i>nil, cxt<i>=</i>null</SAMP> </TD></TR>
<TR> <TD align=left> <SAMP>(foo (+ a 1) (- y 1))</SAMP> </TD> <TD align=left> <SAMP>x<i>=</i>(+ a 1), y<i>=</i>(- y 1),
cxt<i>=</i>null</SAMP> </TD></TR>
<TR> <TD align=left> <SAMP>(foo a b :cxt (zap zip))</SAMP> </TD> <TD align=left> <SAMP>x<i>=</i>a, y<i>=</i>b, cxt<i>=</i>(zap zip)</SAMP> 
</table>

<p>Note that the values of the variables are the actual expressions <SAMP>(+ a 1)</SAMP> and <SAMP>(zap zip)</SAMP>.  There is no requirement that these
expressions' values be known, or even that they have values.  The macro
can do anything it likes with them.  For instance, here's an even more
useless variant of <SAMP>setq</SAMP>: <SAMP>(setq-reversible <i>e<sub>1</sub></i> <i>e<sub>2</sub></i> <i>d</i>)</SAMP>
behaves like <SAMP>(setq <i>e<sub>1</sub></i> <i>e<sub>2</sub></i>)</SAMP> if <i>d=</i><SAMP>:normal</SAMP>, and behaves like
<SAMP>(setq <i>e<sub>2</sub></i> <i>e<sub>1</sub></i>)</SAMP> if <i>d=</i><SAMP>:backward</SAMP>.  It could be defined thus:
<pre>
(defmacro setq-reversible (e1 e2 d)
   (case d 
      (:normal (list 'setq e1 e2))
      (:backward (list 'setq e2 e1))
      (t (error ...))))
</pre>

<hr><H2><FONT color=black>Backquote</FONT></H2>

<p>Before taking another step, we need to introduce a piece of Lisp
notation that is indispensable to defining macros, even though
technically it is quite independent of macros.  This is the <EM>backquote facility</EM>.  As we saw above, the main job of a macro, when
all is said and done, is to define a piece of Lisp code, and that
means evaluating expressions such as <SAMP>(list 
'prog (list 'setq ...) ...)</SAMP>.  As these expressions grow in
complexity, it becomes hard to read them and write them.  What we find
ourselves wanting is a notation that provides the skeleton of an
expression, with some of the pieces filled in with new expressions.
That's what backquote provides.  Instead of the the <SAMP>list</SAMP>
expression given above, one writes
<pre>
    <b><font color=#000099>`</font></b>(progn (setq ,v1 ,e) (setg ,v2 ,e))
</pre>
The backquote (<SAMP><b><font color=#000099>`</font></b></SAMP>) character signals that in the expression that
follows, every subexpression <EM>not</EM> preceded by a comma is to be
quoted, and every subexpression preceded by a comma is to be
evaluated.  

<p>That's mostly all there is to backquote.  There are just two extra
items to point out.  First, if you write "<SAMP>,@<i>e</i></SAMP>'' instead of
"<SAMP>,<i>e</i></SAMP>'' then the  value of <i>e</i> is spliced into the result.  So
if <SAMP>v<i>=</i>(oh boy)</SAMP>, then <SAMP><b><font color=#000099>`</font></b>(zap ,@v ,v)</SAMP> evaluates to <SAMP>(zap oh boy
(oh boy))</SAMP>.  The second occurrence of <SAMP>v</SAMP> is replaced by its
value.  The first is replaced by the elements of its value.  If <SAMP>v</SAMP> had had value <SAMP>()</SAMP>, it would have disappeared entirely: the
value of <SAMP>(zap ,@v ,v)</SAMP> would have been <SAMP>(zap ())</SAMP>, which is the same as
<SAMP>(zap nil)</SAMP>.  

<p>Second, one might wonder what happens if a backquote expression occurs
inside another backquote.  The answer is that the backquote becomes
essentially unreadable and unwriteable; using nested backquote is
usually a tedious debugging exercise.  The reason, in my not-so-humble
opinion, is that backquote is defined wrong.  A comma pairs up with
the innermost backquote when the default should be that it pairs up
with the outermost.  But this is not the place for a rant or
tutorial; consult your favorite  Lisp reference for the exact behavior
of nested backquote plus some examples.

<p>One problem with backquote is that once you learn it you tend to use
for every list-building occasion.  For instance, you might write
<pre>
(mapcan (lambda (x)
           (cond ((symbolp x) <b><font color=#000099>`</font></b>((,x)))
                 ((&gt; x 10) <b><font color=#000099>`</font></b>(,x ,x))
                 (t '())))
        some-list)
</pre>
which yields <SAMP>((a) 15 15)</SAMP> when <SAMP>some-list</SAMP> = <SAMP>(a 6 15)</SAMP>.
The problem is that <SAMP>mapcan</SAMP> destructively alters the results
returned by the <SAMP>lambda</SAMP>-expression.  Can we be sure that the
lists returned by that expression are "fresh,'' that is, they are
different (in the <SAMP>eq</SAMP> sense) from the structures returned on
other calls of that <SAMP>lambda</SAMP> expression?  In the present case,
close analysis will show that they must be fresh, but in general
backquote is not obligated to return a fresh list every time (whether
it does or not is implementation-dependent).  If the example above got
changed to 
<pre>
(mapcan (lambda (x)
           (cond ((symbolp x) <b><font color=#000099>`</font></b>((,x)))
                 ((&gt; x 10) <b><font color=#000099>`</font></b>(,x ,x))
                 ((&gt;= x 0) <b><font color=#000099>`</font></b>(low))
                 (t '())))
        some-list)
</pre>
then backquote may well treat <SAMP><b><font color=#000099>`</font></b>(low)</SAMP> as if it were <SAMP>'(low)</SAMP>;
the list will be allocated at load time, and every time the <SAMP>lambda</SAMP> is evaluated, that same chunk of storage will be returned.  So
if we  evaluate the expression with <SAMP>some-list</SAMP> = <SAMP>(a 6 15)</SAMP>,
we will get <SAMP>((a) low 15 15)</SAMP>, but as a side effect the constant
<SAMP>(low)</SAMP> will get clobbered to become <SAMP>(low 15 15)</SAMP>.  If we
then evaluate the expression with, say, <SAMP>some-list</SAMP> = <SAMP>(8
oops)</SAMP>, the result will be <SAMP>(low 15 15 (oops))</SAMP>, and now the
"constant'' that started off as <SAMP>'(low)</SAMP> will be <SAMP>(low 15 15
(oops))</SAMP>.<font size=-1>[Note: The bug exemplified here takes other forms, and has
often bit newbies - as well as experienced programmers - in the
ass.  The general form is that a constant list is produced as the
value of something that is later destructively altered.  The first
line of defense against this bug is never to destructively alter any
list.  For newbies, this is also the last line of defense.  For those
of us who imagine we're more sophisticated, the next line of defense is
to think very carefully any time you use <SAMP>nconc</SAMP> or <SAMP>mapcan</SAMP>.]</font>

<p>To fix the bug, you can write <SAMP>(map 'list ...)</SAMP> instead of <SAMP>mapcan</SAMP>.  However, if you are determined to use <SAMP>mapcan</SAMP>, write
the expression this way:
<pre>
(mapcan (lambda (x)
           (cond ((symbolp x) (list <b><font color=#000099>`</font></b>(,x)))
                 ((&gt; x 10) (list x x))
                 ((&gt;= x 0) (list 'low))
                 (t '())))
        some-list)
</pre>

<p>My personal preference is to use backquote <EM>only</EM> to build
S-expressions, that is, hierarchical expressions that consist of
symbols, numbers, and strings, and that are not conceptualized as
changing in length.  For instance, I would never write 
<pre>
   (setq sk <b><font color=#000099>`</font></b>(,x ,@sk))
</pre>
If <SAMP>sk</SAMP> is being used as a stack, that is, it's going to be <SAMP>pop</SAMP>ped in the normal course of things, I would write tt  (push x
sk).  If not, I would write <SAMP>(setq sk (cons x sk))</SAMP>.

<hr><H2><FONT color=black>Getting Macros Right</FONT></H2>

<p>I said in section&nbsp;<a href="#sec:macrointro">here</a> that my definition of <SAMP>setq2</SAMP> wasn't quite right, and now it's time to fix it.

<p>Suppose we write <SAMP>(setq2 x y (+ x 3))</SAMP>, when <SAMP>x</SAMP><i>=8</i>.  Then
according to the definition given above, this form will expand into 
<SAMP>(progn (setq x (+ x 3)) (setq y (+ x 3)))</SAMP>, so that <SAMP>x</SAMP> will
have value 11 and <SAMP>y</SAMP> will have value 14.  Chances are that isn't
what the macro is expected to do (although you never know).  Another
problematic case is <SAMP>(setq2 x y (pop l))</SAMP>, which causes <SAMP>l</SAMP> to
be popped twice; again, probably not right.

<p>The solution is to evaluate <SAMP>e</SAMP> just once, save it in a temporary
variable, and then set <SAMP>v1</SAMP> and <SAMP>v2</SAMP> to it.  To make temporary
variables, we use the <SAMP>gensym</SAMP> function, which returns a fresh
variable guaranteed to appear nowhere else.  Here is what the macro
should look like:
<pre>
(defmacro setq2 (v1 v2 e)
   (let ((tempvar (gensym)))
      <b><font color=#000099>`</font></b>(let ((,tempvar ,e))
          (progn (setq ,v1 ,tempvar) 
                 (setq ,v2 ,tempvar)))))
</pre>
Now <SAMP>(setq2 x y (+ x 3))</SAMP> expands to 
<pre>
   (let ((#:g2003 (+ x 3)))
      (progn (setq x #:g2003) (setq y #:g2003)))
</pre>
Here <SAMP>gensym</SAMP> has returned the symbol <SAMP>#:g2003</SAMP>, which prints
in this funny way because it won't be recognized by the reader.  (Nor
is there any need for the reader to recognize it, since it exists only
long enough for the code that contains it to be compiled.)  

<p>Exercise: Verify that this new version works correctly for the case
<SAMP>(setq2 x y (pop l1))</SAMP>.

<p>Exercise: Try writing the new version of the macro without using
backquote.  If you can't do it, you have done the exercise correctly,
and learned what backquote is for!

<p>The moral of this section is to think carefully about which
expressions in a macro get evaluated and when.  Be on the lookout for
situations where the same expression gets plugged into the output
twice (as <SAMP>e</SAMP> was in my original macro design).  For complex
macros, watch out for cases where the order that expressions are
evaluated differs from the order in which they are written.  This is
sure to trip up some user of the macro - even if you are the only
user.

<p><a name="LtohTOCentry-4"></a>
<hr><H2><FONT color=black>What Macros are For</FONT></H2>

<p>Macros are for making syntactic extensions to Lisp.  One often hears
it said that macros are a bad idea, that users can't be trusted with
them, and so forth.  Balderdash.  It is just as reasonable to extend a
language syntactically as to extend it by defining your own
procedures.  It may be true that the casual reader of your code can't
understand the code without seeing the macro definitions, but then the
casual reader can't understand it without seeing function definitions
either.  Having <SAMP>defmethods</SAMP> strewn around several files
contributes far more to unclarity than macros ever have, but that's a
different diatribe.

<p>Before surveying what sorts of syntactic extensions I have found
useful, let me point out what sorts of syntactic extensions are
generally <EM>not</EM> useful, or best accomplished using means other
than macros.  Some novices think macros are useful for open-coding
functions.  So, instead of defining
<pre>
   (defun sqone (x) (let ((y (+ x 1))) (* y y)))
</pre>
they might define
<pre>
   (defmacro sqone (x)
      <b><font color=#000099>`</font></b>(let ((y (+ ,x 1))) (* y y)))
</pre>
So that <SAMP>(sqone (* z 13))</SAMP> might expand into 
<pre>
    (let ((y (+ (* z 13) 1))) (* y y))
</pre>
This is correct, but a waste of effort.  For one thing, the amount of
time saved is almost certainly negligible.  If it's really important
that <SAMP>sqone</SAMP> be expanded inline, one can put <SAMP>(declaim (inline
sqone))</SAMP> before <SAMP>sqone</SAMP> is defined (although the compiler is not
obligated to honor this declaration).  For another, once <SAMP>sqone</SAMP>
is defined as a macro, it becomes impossible to write <SAMP>(mapcar
#'sqone ll)</SAMP>, or 
to do anything else with it except call it.  

<p>But macros have a thousand and one legitimate uses.  Why write <SAMP>(lambda (x) ...)</SAMP> when you can write <SAMP>(<tt>\</tt><tt>\</tt> (x) ...)</SAMP>?  Just
define <tt>\</tt><tt>\</tt> as a macro: <SAMP>(defmacro <tt>\</tt><tt>\</tt> (&amp;rest l) <b><font color=#000099>`</font></b>(lambda
,@l))</SAMP>. 

<p>Many people find <SAMP>mapcar</SAMP> and <SAMP>mapcan</SAMP> a bit too obscure,
especially when used with large <SAMP>lambda</SAMP> expressions.  Rather than
write something like
<pre>
(mapcar (lambda (x)
           (let ((y (hairy-fun1 x)) (z (hairy-fun2 x)))
              (dolist (y1 y)
                 (dolist (z1 z) 
                    <EM>... and further meaningless</EM>
                    <EM>space-filling nonsense...</EM>
                    ))))
        l)
</pre>
we might prefer to write 
<pre>
(for (x :in l)
   (let ((y (hairy-fun1 x)) (z (hairy-fun2 x)))
      (dolist (y1 y)
         (dolist (z1 z) 
            <EM>... and further meaningless</EM>
            <EM>space-filling nonsense...</EM>
            ))))
</pre>

<p>This macro might be defined thus:
<pre>
(defmacro for (listspec exp)
   (cond ((and (= (length listspec) 3)
               (symbolp (car listspec))
               (eq (cadr listspec) ':in))
          <b><font color=#000099>`</font></b>(mapcar (lambda (,(car listspec))
                      ,exp)
                   ,(caddr listspec)))
         (t (error "Ill-formed: %s" <b><font color=#000099>`</font></b>(for ,listspec ,exp)))))
</pre>
(This is a simplified version of a macro by Chris Riesbeck.)

<p>It's worth stopping for a second to discuss the role 
the keyword <SAMP>:in</SAMP> plays in this macro.  It serves as a sort of
"local syntax marker,'' in that it has no meaning as far as Lisp is
concerned, but does serve as a syntactic guidepost for  the macro
itself.  I will refer to these markers as <EM>guide symbols</EM>.
(Here its job may seem trivial, but if we generalized the
<SAMP>for</SAMP> macro to allow multiple list arguments and an implicit <SAMP>progn</SAMP> in the body the <SAMP>:in</SAMP>s would be crucial in telling us where
the arguments stopped and the body began.)

<p>It is not strictly necessary for the guide symbols of a macro to be in
the keyword package, but it is a good idea, for two reasons.  First,
they highlight to the reader that something idiosyncratic is going
on.  A form like <SAMP>(for ((x in (foobar a b 'oof))) (something-hairy
x (list x)))</SAMP> looks a bit wrong already, because of the double
parentheses before the <SAMP>x</SAMP>.  But using "<SAMP>:in</SAMP>'' makes it more
obvious.  

<p>Second, notice that I wrote <SAMP>(eq (cadr listspec) ':in)</SAMP> in the
macro definition to check for the presence of the guide symbol.  If I
had used <SAMP>in</SAMP> instead, I would have had to think about which
package <EM>my</EM> <SAMP>in</SAMP> lives in and which package the macro user's
<SAMP>in</SAMP> lives in.  The safest thing to do would be to write
<pre>
    (and (symbolp (cadr listspec))
         (string= (symbol-name (cadr listspec)) (symbol-name 'in)))
</pre>
which
is just uglier.  The keyword package is there to provide a home for
symbols whose home is not per se relevant to anything; you might as
well use it.<font size=-1>[Note: In ANSI Lisp, 
I could have written <SAMP>"IN"</SAMP> instead of <SAMP>(symbol-name 'in)</SAMP>, but there are Lisp implementations that do not
convert symbols' names to uppercase.  Since I think the whole
uppercase conversion idea is an embarrassing relic, I try to write
code that is portable to those implementations.]</font>

<p>Let's look at another example, both to illustrate a nice macro, and to
provide an auxiliary function for some of the discussion below.  One
often wants to create new symbols in Lisp, and <SAMP>gensym</SAMP> is not
always adequate for building them.  Here is a description of an
alternative facility called <SAMP>build-symbol</SAMP>:
<blockquote>
<SAMP>(build-symbol [(:package <i>p</i>)] <EM>-pieces-</EM>)</SAMP> builds a
symbol by concatenating the given <EM>pieces</EM> and interns it as
specified by <i>p</i>.  For each element 
of <EM>pieces</EM>, if it is a ... 
<UL>
<li><strong></strong> ... string: The string is added to the new symbol's name.
<li><strong></strong> ... symbol: The name of the symbol is added to the new symbol's
name.
<li><strong></strong> ... expression of the form <SAMP>(:&lt; <i>e</i>)</SAMP>: <i>e</i> should evaluate
to a string, symbol, or number; the characters of the value of <i>e</i> (as
printed by 
<SAMP>princ</SAMP>) are concatenated into the new symbol's name.
<li><strong></strong> ... expression of the form <SAMP>(:++ <i>p</i>)</SAMP>: <i>p</i> should be a place expression (i.e.,
appropriate as the first argument to <SAMP>setf</SAMP>), whose value is an
integer; the value is incremented by 1, and the new value is
concatenated intot he new symbol's name.
</UL>
If the <SAMP>:package</SAMP> specification is omitted, it defaults to the
value of <SAMP>*package*</SAMP>.  If <i>p</i> is <SAMP>nil</SAMP>, the symbol is interned nowhere.
Otherwise, it should evaluate to a package designator (usually, a
keyword whose name is the same of a package).
</blockquote>
For example, <SAMP>(build-symbol (:&lt; x) "-" (:++ *x-num*))</SAMP>, when <SAMP>x</SAMP> = <SAMP>foo</SAMP> and 
<SAMP>*x-num*</SAMP> = 8, sets <SAMP>*x-num*</SAMP> to 9 and 
 evaluates to
<SAMP>FOO-9</SAMP>.  If evaluated again, the result will be <SAMP>FOO-10</SAMP>, and so
forth.  

<p>Obviously, <SAMP>build-symbol</SAMP> can't be implemented as a function; it
has to be a macro.  Here is an implementation:

<pre>
(defmacro build-symbol (&rest l)
   (let ((p (find-if (lambda (x) (and (consp x) (eq (car x) ':package)))
                     l)))
      (cond (p
             (setq l (remove p l))))
      (let ((pkg (cond ((eq (cadr p) 'nil)
                        nil)
                       (t `(find-package ',(cadr p))))))
         (cond (p
                (cond (pkg
                       `(values (intern ,(symstuff l) ,pkg)))
                      (t
                       `(make-symbol ,(symstuff l)))))
               (t
                `(values (intern ,(symstuff l))))))))

(defun symstuff (l)
   `(concatenate 'string
      ,@(for (x :in l)
           (cond ((stringp x)
                  `',x)
                 ((atom x)
                  `',(format nil "~a" x))
                 ((eq (car x) ':&lt;)
                  `(format nil "~a" ,(cadr x)))
                 ((eq (car x) ':++)
                  `(format nil "~a" (incf ,(cadr x))))
                 (t
                  `(format nil "~a" ,x))))))
</pre>
<p>(Another approach would be have <SAMP>symstuff</SAMP> return a single call of
the form <SAMP>(format nil <EM>format-string</EM> <EM>-forms-</EM>)</SAMP>,
where the <EM>forms</EM> are derived from the <EM>pieces</EM>, and the <EM>format-string</EM> consists of interleaved ~a's and strings.)

<p>Sometimes a macro is needed only temporarily, as a sort of syntactic
scaffolding.  Suppose you need to define 12 functions, but they fall
into 3 stereotyped groups of 4:
<pre>
(defun make-a-zip (y z) (vector 2 'zip y z))
(defun test-whether-zip (x) (and (vectorp x) (eq (aref x 1) 'zip)))
(defun zip-copy (x) ...)
(defun zip-deactivate (x) ...)

<p>(defun make-a-zap (u v w) (vector 3 'zap u v w))
(defun test-whether-zap (x) ...)
(defun zap-copy (x) ...)
(defun zap-deactivate (x) ...)

<p>(defun make-a-zep () (vector 0 'zep))
(defun test-whether-zep (x) ...)
(defun zep-copy (x) ...)
(defun zep-deactivate (x) ...)
</pre>
Where the omitted pieces are the same in all similarly named
functions.  (That is, the "...'' in <SAMP>zep-deactivate</SAMP> is the
same code as the "...'' in <SAMP>zip-deactivate</SAMP>, and so forth.)
Here, for the sake of concreteness, if not plausibility, <SAMP>zip</SAMP>,
<SAMP>zap</SAMP>, and <SAMP>zep</SAMP> are behaving like odd little data structures.
The functions could be rather large, and it would get tedious
keeping them all in synch as they are debugged.  An alternative would
be to use a macro:
<pre>
(defmacro odd-define (name buildargs)
   <b><font color=#000099>`</font></b>(progn (defun ,(build-symbol make-a- (:&lt; name)) 
                                 ,buildargs
              (vector ,(length buildargs) ',name ,@buildargs))
           (defun ,(build-symbol test-whether- (:&lt; name)) (x)
              (and (vectorp x) (eq (aref x 1) ',name))
           (defun ,(build-symbol (:&lt; name) -copy) (x) 
              ...)
           (defun ,(build-symbol (:&lt; name) -deactivate) (x) 
              ...))))

<p>(odd-define zip (y z))
(odd-define zap (u v w))
(odd-define zep ())
</pre>

<p>If all the uses of this macro are collected in this one place, it
might be clearer to make it a local macro using <SAMP>macrolet</SAMP>:

<p><pre>
(macrolet ((odd-define (name buildargs)
              <b><font color=#000099>`</font></b>(progn (defun ,(build-symbol make-a- (:&lt; name)) 
                                            ,buildargs
                         (vector ,(length buildargs) 
                                 ',name
                                  ,@buildargs))
                      (defun ,(build-symbol test-whether- (:&lt; name)) 
                             (x)
                         (and (vectorp x) (eq (aref x 1) ',name))
                      (defun ,(build-symbol (:&lt; name) -copy) (x) 
                         ...)
                      (defun ,(build-symbol (:&lt; name) -deactivate) (x)
                          ...)))))
   (odd-define zip (y z))
   (odd-define zap (u v w))
   (odd-define zep ()))
</pre>

<p>Finally, macros are essential for defining "command languages.''
A <EM>command</EM> is a function with a short name for use by users in
interacting with Lisp's read-eval-print loop.  A short name is useful
and possible because we want it to be easy to type and we don't care
much whether the name clashes some other command; if two command
names clash, we can change one of them.  

<p>As an example, let's define a little command language for debugging
macros.  (You may actually find this useful.)  There are just two
commands, <SAMP>ex</SAMP> and <SAMP>fi</SAMP>. 
They keep track of a "current form,'' the thing to be macro-expanded
or the result of such an expansion:
<OL>
<li><strong></strong>  <SAMP>(ex [<EM>form</EM>])</SAMP>: Apply <SAMP>macro-expand1</SAMP> to <EM>form</EM> (if supplied) or the current form,
and make the  result the current form.  Then pretty-print the current form.
<li><strong></strong> <SAMP>(fi <i>s</i> [<i>k</i>])</SAMP>: Find the <i>k</i>'th subexpression of the
current form whose <SAMP>car</SAMP> is <i>s</i>. (<i>k</i> defaults to 0.)   Make that
subexpression the current form and pretty-print it.
</OL>

<p>Suppose you're trying to debug a macro <SAMP>hair-squared</SAMP> that expands
into something complex containing a subform that is itself a macro
form beginning with the symbol <SAMP>odd-define</SAMP>.  You suspect there is
a bug in the subform.  You might issue the following commands:
<pre>
 &gt; (ex (hair-squared ...))
(PROGN (DEFUN ...)
         (ODD-DEFINE ZIP (U V W))
         ...)
 &gt; (fi odd-define)
 (ODD-DEFINE ZIP (U V W))
 &gt; (ex)
 (PROGN (DEFUN MAKE-A-ZIP (U V W) ...)        
    ...)
</pre>

<p>Once again, it is clear that <SAMP>ex</SAMP> and <SAMP>fi</SAMP> cannot be
functions, although they could easily be made into functions if we
were willing to type a quote before their arguments.  But using
"quote'' often seems inappropriate in commands.  For one thing,
having to type it is a nuisance in a context where we are trying to
save keystrokes, especially if the argument in question is 
always quoted.
For another, in many cases it just seems
inappropriate.  If we 
had a command that took a symbol as one of its arguments and set it to
a value, it would just be strange to write <SAMP>(<EM>command</EM> 'x
...)</SAMP> instead of <SAMP>(<EM>command</EM> x ...)</SAMP>, because we want to
think of the command as a variant of <SAMP>setq</SAMP>.  

<p>Here is how <SAMP>ex</SAMP> and <SAMP>fi </SAMP> might be defined:

<pre>
(defvar *current-form*)

(defmacro ex (&optional (form nil form-supplied))
   `(progn
       (pprint (setq *current-form*
                     (macroexpand-1
                        ,(cond (form-supplied
                                `',form)
                               (t '*current-form*)))))
       (values)))

(defmacro fi (s &optional (k 0))
   `(progn
       (pprint (setq *current-form*
                    (find-nth-occurrence ',s *current-form* ,k)))
       (values)))
</pre>
<p>
The <SAMP>ex</SAMP> macro expands to a form containing a call to <SAMP>macroexpand-1</SAMP>, a built-in function that does one step of macro
expansion to a form whose <SAMP>car</SAMP> is the name of a macro.  (If given
some other form, it returns the form unchanged.)  <SAMP>pprint</SAMP> is a
built-in function that pretty-prints its argument.  Because we are
using <SAMP>ex</SAMP> and <SAMP>fi</SAMP> at a read-eval-print loop, any value
returned by their expansions will be printed.  Here the expansion is
executed for side effect, so we arrange to return no values at all by
having the expansion return <SAMP>(values)</SAMP>.  

<p>In some Lisp
implementations, read-eval-print loops routinely print results using
<SAMP>pprint</SAMP>.  In those implementations we could simplify <SAMP>ex</SAMP> and
<SAMP>fi</SAMP> by having them print nothing, but just return the value of <SAMP>*current-form*</SAMP>, which the read-eval-print loop will then print prettily.
Use your judgment.

<p>I leave the definition of <SAMP>find-nth-occurrence</SAMP> as an exercise.  
You might also want to define a command that just sets and prints the
current form: <SAMP>(cf <i>e</i>)</SAMP>.  

<p>One caution: In general, command languages
will consist of a mixture of macros and functions, with convenience
for their definer (and usually sole user) being the main
consideration.  If a command seems to "want'' to evaluate some of its
arguments sometimes, you have to decide whether to define two (or
more) versions 
of it, or just one, a function whose arguments must be quoted to
prevent their being evaluated.  For the <SAMP>cf</SAMP> command mentioned in
the prevous paragraph, some users might prefer <SAMP>cf</SAMP> to  be a
function, some a macro.
