ANSI Common Lisp does not provide standard functions to
operate on sockets, but all major CL implementations have
added socket support to their environments. Although all
socket packages offer roughly the same functionalities, they
use slightly different names for functions, making it hard
to provide a standardized description. In this chapter, we
will use the socket library contained in <A
href="http://clocc.sourceforge.net/dist/port.html">PORT</A>,
that in turn is part of the <A
href="http://clocc.sourceforge.net/">Common Lisp Open Code
Collection</A> (CLOCC). The socket functions provided by
PORT currently work without modifications on a wide range of
Common Lisp implementations (Allegro, Lispworks, CLISP, CMU
CL, SBCL, GCL).  Therefore, this section does not contain
pointers to the Common Lisp HyperSpec. We refer you to the
documentation of the PORT package for more information. Even 
if you do not use port, the concepts described here will most 
likely apply to your Lisp implementation, and it should not
be hard to find out what the equivalent functions are in it.


<a name="intro"></a>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>First of all, some theory. If you are interested in using sockets
you probably already know this stuff, but it is useful to go through
it anyway to establish our terminology. A <b>socket</b> is a
communication channel between two processes, usually (but not
necessarily) running on different computers. Several types of sockets
exist, but in the following we are only going to describe <b>TCP</b>
sockets, that implement a reliable, two-way communication stream.  A
socket connection originates from a <b>port</b> on a <b>client</b>
machine, and reaches another port on a <b>server</b>
machine. Therefore, a connected socket is identified by four data
elements: the address of the client computer, the port on the client
computer, the address of the server computer and the port on the
server computer. This particular way of using sockets is referred to
as the "Internet" address family. Under Unix, there is also an
alternative address family ("Unix") that uses local files as sockets. 
In the following we will describe how to implement both TCP clients
and servers in Common Lisp. Of course, nothing prevents you from using
a CL client to connect to a server written in a different language,
and vice-versa.</p>

<p>Addresses can be represented in three different ways. The one you
are probably most familiar with is the human-readable form, such as
<tt>www.lisp.org</tt>. We will call this a <b>hostname</b>. Each
hostname may be associated with one or more <b>IP addresses</b>, each
represented by four bytes. These are usually written in <b>dotted</b>
notation: <tt>128.18.65.4</tt>. The translation between a hostname and
a dotted IP address is called a <b>DNS lookup</b>, and normally occurs
behind the scenes in modern systems. Finally, an address can be easily
converted from dotted notation to an <b>ipaddr</b>, which is simply
the long integer formed by the four bytes in the dotted address. The
ipaddr corresponding to the above example is 2148679940. To summarize:
humans use hostnames that are easier to memorize and type; software
uses IP addresses that are stored as ipaddrs but are usually printed
in dotted notation.</p>
      
<p>Ports are represented as integer numbers in the range
1-65535. In general, ports can be chosen arbitrarily (except that
some ports might only be available to privileged users on Unix and
similar operating systems), but two processes that need to
communicate through sockets should have a way of knowing which
port to use. Let's look at how sockets are normally used, in order 
to make this point clear. 
<ol>
  <li>A process on computer A (the server) <b>opens</b> TCP port X
    and prepares to <b>accept</b> connections.</li>
  <li>A process on computer B (the client) <b>creates</b> a socket 
    connecting port Y on B to port X on A. (Note that B needs to
    know that A opened port X, but A does not need to know that
    the socket originates from port Y on B. Y is usually chosen
    randomly by the TCP implementation.)</li>
  <li>The server process accepts the socket connection, and spawns 
    a thread or a sub-process to <b>handle</b> it.</li>
  <li>A and B can freely exchange data over the socket, until
    either the client or the server closes it.</li>
</ol>


<a name="adr"></a>
<h3>Addresses</h3>

<p>A prerequisite for working with sockets is the ability to
convert hostnames to IP addresses and vice versa. The function
RESOLVE-HOST-IPADDR takes a hostname as its argument and returns 
a HOSTENT structure. For example:

<pre>
&gt; (resolve-host-ipaddr "www.lisp.org")
#S(HOSTENT :NAME "bibop.alu.org" :ALIASES NIL :ADDR-LIST ("128.18.65.4") :ADDR-TYPE 2)
</pre>

This structure contains four fields, but the only ones we are
interested in are NAME and ADDR-LIST. NAME contains the
<i>canonical</i> hostname of the machine (that might or might not
be the same as the argument), while ADDR-LIST contains the IP
address corresponding to the given hostname (in some cases a
hostname is mapped to more than one IP address for load-balancing
purposes, but not all implementations return the additional
addresses). You can also use this function to perform the reverse
mapping: 

<pre>
&gt; (resolve-host-ipaddr "128.18.65.4")
#S(HOSTENT :NAME "bibop.alu.org" :ALIASES NIL :ADDR-LIST ("128.18.65.4") :ADDR-TYPE 2)
</pre>

The functions DOTTED-TO-IPADDR and IPADDR-TO-DOTTED are used to
convert from dotted notation to ipaddrs:

<pre>
&gt; (dotted-to-ipaddr "128.18.65.4")
2148679940
&gt; (ipaddr-to-dotted 2148679940)
"128.18.65.4"
</pre>


<a name="server"></a>
<h3>Server sockets</h3>

<P>As we saw earlier, the first step in setting up a socket
consists in the server process <i>opening a port</i>. This is
accomplished with the OPEN-SOCKET-SERVER function, that
takes the port number (an integer) as its argument and
returns an object representing the open socket port. There
are two ways that things could go wrong at this stage:
either your process does not have sufficient privileges to
open the desired port (for example, you are trying to open a 
port below 1024 without being root under unix), or the
port you have chosen has already been opened by another
process. In both cases, Lisp will signal an error.

<P>Assuming you have successfully opened the server port,
your process should now start waiting for incoming
connections. The function SOCKET-ACCEPT takes the &quot;open
port&quot; structure returned by OPEN-SOCKET-SERVER as
input, and waits until a connection attempt is received on
the port. The keyword argument :WAIT controls how the
waiting happens exactly: if it is specified and is a
positive number, the function will wait for a connection for
the specified number of seconds at most. If a connection is
not received before timeout, the function returns NIL. If
:WAIT is not specified, the function waits forever. When a
connection is received, the function returns a
&quot;socket-stream&quot; object, and the server process
turns to handling the connection.

<P>If the Lisp environment you are using supports multiple
processes or threads, you can take advantage of this feature
to avoid tying up the server when handling a connection. The
problem is that while it is executing code to handle a
connection, the server cannot call SOCKET-ACCEPT, and
therefore other clients trying to connect will not be
served. Using multiprocessing, you can prevent this from
happening by spawning a new process to handle each request,
so that the main process is always available to accept new
connections. For example:

<pre>
;; Open the server socket
(let ((server (open-socket-server 4141)))
  (loop

    ;; Listen for incoming connections
    (let ((socket (socket-accept server)))
  
      ;; Spawn a process to handle the connection
      (make-process "Connection handler"
                    #'handle-connection
                    socket))

    ;; The main process is now free to accept a new connection
    ))
</pre>

<P>We assumed the existence of a function called
MAKE-PROCESS that creates a new Lisp thread to run a
function call. In this case the thread runs a user-defined
function called HANDLE-CONNECTION that takes the socket
stream as its only argument and operates on it. After
handing the connection to the subprocess, the main process
immediately returns to the SOCKET-ACCEPT call to wait for
another incoming connection. This basic structure could be 
extended to limit the number of concurrent processes,
to perform load balancing, request logging, etc.
            

<a name="client"></a>
<h3>Client sockets</h3>

<p>Let's now look at the other side of the story. On the client 
machine, the Lisp process should call OPEN-SOCKET,
specifying both the host to connect to and the port
number. The host can be specified in any of the formats we
saw above, while the port should be an integer. Several
scenarios are possible now:

<ul>
  <li>The destination port is open and the server process is 
    listening. In this case the connection is established,
    and OPEN-SOCKET returns a &quot;socket-stream&quot;
    structure.</li>
  <li>The destination port was opened but the server process 
    did not call SOCKET-ACCEPT. In this case the connection
    will be established and put in a backlog queue by the operating
    system (provided there is still room in the queue), until the
    server process gets around to calling SOCKET-ACCEPT. Things
    then proceed as in the previous case.</li>
  <li>The specified port was not opened on the remote
    machine. In this case OPEN-SOCKET returns immediately
    with a &quot;connection refused&quot; error.</li>
</li>

</ul>

<P>Note that the socket-stream structures returned to the
server and client processes when a connection is
successfully established are simmetrical: each of them
contains two pairs (IP address, port number) for both the
local and the remote end of the socket. The roles of the
two pairs will be reversed in the two structures, that is:

<pre>
#&lt;SOCKET-STREAM [A:X] to [B:Y]&gt; (on A)
#&lt;SOCKET-STREAM [B:Y] to [A:X]&gt; (on B)
</pre>

<P>The function SOCKET-HOST/PORT returns the four pieces of
information in a socket-stream structure as multiple values.


<a name="comm"></a>
<h3>Communication</h3>

<P>Once both the client and the server are in possession of
an open socket stream, they can start communicating. Since
socket streams are a type of streams, the two agents can
communicate by writing to them (e.g., using FORMAT) and
reading from them (e.g. using READ-LINE or READ). This is,
for example, how the client would send a string to the
server:

<pre>
&gt; (format client-stream "Username: user1~%")
&gt; (force-output client-stream)
</pre>

And the server would do the following to read the message:

<pre>
&gt; (read-line server-stream)
"Username: user1"
</pre>
          
Note that since socket streams are usually buffered, the
data is actually sent over the network only when the buffer
is full, when the stream is closed or when you call
FORCE-OUTPUT on the stream. If you need to be sure that the
data is sent out (for example, because you are then
expecting an answer), it is a good idea to call FORCE-OUTPUT
after all output operations. Note also that communication
can take place in both directions at once. Finally, what we
said so far applies to text data. In some implementations
you can send binary data over a socket using the same
techniques, in other implementations you have to specify
whether the socket is going to be used for text or binary
data.

<a name="close"></a>
<h3>Closing</h3>

The socket can be closed by either party, by calling the
regular CL function CLOSE on the sockets. The server can
close the server socket with the function
SOCKET-SERVER-CLOSE.


<a name="example"></a>
<h3>A complete example</h3>

In this section we will implement a very simple HTTP/0.9
server and client. HTTP/0.9 is a primitive version of the
HTTP protocol currently used by all Web servers and
clients. It is a very simple query-response protocol whose 
only purpose is to allow a client to retrieve a document
from a server. The client sends a request line with the
following format:

<pre>
GET /pathname/to/file HTTP/0.9
</pre>

followed by a blank line, and the server replies with the 
contents of the specified file. Here is the code:

<pre>
--------------------------cut here------------------------------------
(in-package :port)

;;; Utilities

(defun http-send-line (stream line)
  "Send a line of text to the HTTP stream, terminating it with CR+LF."
  (princ line stream)
  (princ #\Return stream)
  (princ #\Newline stream))
;;; Server

(defun http-0.9-server (port root)
  "Run an HTTP/0.9 server on `port'. `root' is the pathname to the
directory where the HTML pages are stored."
  (let ((server (open-socket-server port)))
    (format t "&gt; Started server on port ~d~%" port)
    (unwind-protect
        (loop
          (let ((socket (socket-accept server)))
            (unwind-protect
                (process-request socket
                                 (read-request socket)
                                 root)
              ;; Close connection when done
              (close socket))))
      
      ;; Close server before exiting
      (socket-server-close server))))

(defun read-request (socket)
  "Read an HTTP/0.9 request from `socket' and determine the
corresponding filename. An HTTP/0.9 request has the form:

GET /filename HTTP/0.9

Returns the filename, or NIL if the request is incorrect."
  
  (let ((request (read-line socket nil nil)))
    (when request
      (let ((p1 (position #\Space request))
            (p2 (position #\Space request :from-end t)))
        (when (and p1 p2)
          (subseq request (1+ p1) p2))))))

(defun process-request (socket filename root)
  (format t "&gt; Received request from host ~a~%"
          (socket-host/port socket))
  ;; discard empty line
  (read-line socket)
  (if filename
      ;; Correct request, serve file
      (serve-file socket
                  (concatenate 'string root filename))
    ;; Incorrect request, return error
    (http-send-line socket "HTTP/0.9 400 Invalid HTTP Request."))
  
  ;; Make sure the client sees the output - not really
  ;; necessary since we close the socket right after this.
  (force-output socket))

(defun serve-file (socket pathname)
  "Write the contents of the file `pathname' to `socket'."
  ;; Does file exist?
  (if (probe-file pathname)
      
      ;; Yes, write it out to the socket
      (with-open-file (in pathname)
        (format t "&gt; Serving file ~a...~%" pathname)
        (loop
          (let ((line (read-line in nil nil)))
            (unless line (return))
            (http-send-line socket line))))
    
    ;; No, return error
    (format socket "HTTP/0.9 401 Not found.~%")))

;;; Client

(defun http-get (server port path)
  "Send a request for file `path' to an HTTP/0.9 server on host
`server', port number `port'. Print the contents of the returned file
to standard output."
  ;; Open connection
  (let ((socket (open-socket server port)))
    (unwind-protect
        (progn
          (format t "&gt; Sending request to ~a:~a...~%" server port)
          ;; Send request
          (http-send-line socket (format nil "GET ~a HTTP/0.9~%~%" path))
          (force-output socket)
          
          ;; Read response and output it
          (format t "&gt; Received response:~%")
          (loop
            (let ((line (read-line socket nil nil)))
              (unless line (return))
              (format t "~a~%" line))))
      
      ;; Close socket before exiting.
      (close socket))))
--------------------------cut here------------------------------------
</pre>

To run this example you should open two Lisp listeners,
and load the PORT package followed by the above code into
both of them. On one of them (the server) call:

<pre>
(http-0.9-server 8080 "/etc/")
</pre>

(You can select any directory as the root, and exposing the
contents of /etc is usually not a good idea, but of course
this is just an example). You will not see anything
happening, meaning that the server is idle waiting for
connection. Then in the second listener (the client) call:

<pre>
(http-get "localhost" 8080 "/hosts")
</pre>

and you should see the contents of your /etc/hosts file
printed to standard output. In this case we used "localhost" 
as the server's hostname because we are running both the
client and the server on the same machine for simplicity,
but of course they could be on two different machines. Note
that the server runs forever, you will have to interrupt it
manually after you have finished trying it.
