<a name="intro"></a><h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>By <cite>threads</cite>, I mean separate execution strands within a
single Lisp process, sharing the same address space. Typically,
execution is automatically switched between these strands by the
system (either by the lisp kernel or by the operating system) so that
tasks appear to be completed in parallel (asynchronously). This page
discusses the creation and management of threads and some aspects of
interactions between them. For information about the interaction
between lisp and other <cite>processes</cite>, see <a
href="os.html">Interfacing with your OS</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, an instant pitfall for the unwary is that most
implementations refer (in nomenclature) to threads as
<cite>processes</cite> - this is a historical feature of a language
which has been around for much longer than the term
<cite>thread</cite>. Call this maturity a sign of stable
implementations, if you will.</p>

<p>The ANSI Common Lisp standard doesn't mention this topic. So almost
everything that can be said here depends on your OS and your
implementation. It's not just a question of different symbols in
different packages (although that might be enough to get you started,
so see the <a
href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/portableaserve/portableaserve/acl-compat/">acl-compat</a>
package at Sourceforge and in particular the files whose names match
"acl-mp-*.lisp") - concepts can vary too.</p>

<p>Speaking of implementations, the following discussion currently
refers only to <a href="http://www.xanalys.com/">Xanalys</a> <a
href="http://www.xanalys.com/software_tools/products/">LispWorks</a>.
It has been tested on LispWorks for Windows Professional version 4.2.6
running on Windows NT (SP 6). All the examples below (apart from those
few which require resaving the lisp image) should work without
difficulty on the (free) Personal edition running under either Linux
or Windows.</p>

<p>Your mileage may vary. I will add "support" for other
implementations and operating systems to this page later, if I have
the time and access to the appropriate materials.</p>

<p>In any case, read the manual! In this instance, the manual
concerned is the chapter on "The MP Package" in the "LispWorks
Reference Manual".</p>

<p>Pre-requisite: I assume familiarity with Common Lisp, in
particular with closures, the loop macro, and lambda forms.</p>

<a name="why_bother"></a><h3>Why bother?</h3>

<p>The first question to resolve is: why bother with threads?
Sometimes your answer will simply be that your application is so
straightforward that you need not concern yourself with threads at
all. But in many other cases it's difficult to imagine how a
sophisticated application can be written without multi-threading. For
example:</p>

<ul>

<li>you might be writing a server which needs to be able to respond to
more than one user / connection at a time (for instance: a web server
- see <a href="./sockets.html#server">this example</a> on the Sockets
page);</li>

<li>you might want to perform some background activity, without
halting the main application while this is going on;</li>

<li>you might want your application to be notified when a certain time
has elapsed;</li>

<li>you might want to keep the application running and active while
waiting for some system resource to become available;</li>

<li>you might need to interface with some other system which requires
multithreading (for example, "windows" under Windows which generally
run in their own threads);</li>

<li>you might want to associate different contexts (e.g. different
dynamic bindings) with different parts of the application;</li>

<li>you might even have the simple need to do two things at once.</li>

</ul>

<a name="emergency"></a><h3>Emergency exits</h3>

<p>It's fairly likely when you're learning to work with threads that -
every now and again - one of them will run away from you and either
fall motionless at your feet or make some CPU-intensive break for
freedom. If you've managed to get your lisp tangled you may be short
on options for halting a runaway thread, short of killing the lisp
altogether.</p>

<p>Before you go any further, you might want to locate the "Process
Browser". Aptly enough, you'll find it on the LispWorks podium under
the icon of somebody running away. Open one <strong>before</strong>
you get into trouble. To kill a process which won't respond to polite
coercion, select it in the Process Browser and then click the "skull
and crossbones" icon.</p>


<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Type <code>(mp:process-run-function
"Foo" () (lambda () (loop)))</code> into a listener and use the
Process Browser to kill the thread.</p>


<a name="basics"></a><h3>Basics</h3>

<p>In order to run a function in a separate thread, you need to do two
things.</p>

<ol>

<li>Make sure that multithreading is running. By default,
multithreading is always running in the LispWorks for Windows
environment so in this case there is nothing to do. See
<a href="#initializing">initializing multithreading</a> below to find
out how to get threads running on other platforms.</li>

<li>Now call your function, in its new thread. For example:

<pre>
(defvar *foo* 0)
(defun foo () (incf *foo*))
(mp:process-run-function "Incrementing *foo*" nil 'foo)
*foo*  => 1
</pre>

</li>
</ol>

<p>In the above example, you created a new thread called
<code>"Incrementing *foo*"</code>. The function <code>foo</code> was
invoked (with no arguments) in that thread. When <code>foo</code>
returned, the thread no longer had any work to do and so was
terminated.</p>

<p>Note the following:</p>

<ul>

<li>The first argument to <code>mp:process-run-function</code> is a
string naming the thread. You don't have to make the names unique, but
it's a smart move if you do in actual code, as it's a great way to
tell your threads apart when you're debugging them. When playing
around in the listener, you'll often find no harm in using an empty
string here.</li>

<li>The second argument to <code>mp:process-run-function</code> is a
list of <cite>process initialization keywords</cite>. You'll almost
always leave this empty (so you needn't bother about any details).</li>

<li>The third argument is the function to invoke in the new
thread. This can be any function designator, for example, an
<code>fboundp</code> symbol or a <code>lambda</code> form. </li>

<li>Any remaining arguments to <code>mp:process-run-function</code>
are passed to your function. So calls to
<code>mp:process-run-function</code> look like calls to
<code>funcall</code> with two additional arguments at the
beginning.</li>

<li>A call to <code>mp:process-run-function</code> returns immediately
(the return value is of type <code>mp:process</code>), while the new
thread executes asynchronously.</li>

</ul>

<p>Another simple example:</p>

<pre>
CL-USER 15 &gt; (mp:process-run-function "sleep in the background" nil 'sleep 10)
#&lt;MP:PROCESS Name "sleep in the background" Priority 850000 State "Running"&gt;

CL-USER 16 &gt; (mp:find-process-from-name "sleep in the background")
#&lt;MP:PROCESS Name "sleep in the background" Priority 0 State "Sleeping on mailbox"&gt;

CL-USER 17 &gt; (sleep 10)  ;; At this point the listener sleeps for ten seconds -
NIL                      ;; long enough for the new thread to run to completion.

CL-USER 18 &gt; (mp:find-process-from-name "sleep in the background")
NIL                      ;; The sleeping thread has finished its job and terminated.

CL-USER 19 &gt;
</pre>

<p><strong>Closures! Warning!</strong> Note the difference between:</p>

<pre>(dotimes (i 20)
  (mp:process-run-function "One closure" ()
                           (lambda () (print i #.*standard-output*))))
</pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre>
(dotimes (i 20)
  (mp:process-run-function "Twenty different bindings" ()
                           (lambda (j) (print j #.*standard-output*))
                           i))
</pre>

<p>In the first case, all twenty threads share the same closure
variable <code>i</code>. The threads execute
<cite>asynchronously</cite> - in other words there's no way to tell
exactly when or in what order they'll execute, or how they'll
interleave with the thread which created them. In this case (try it!)
you will observe that LispWorks initialises all 20 threads before any
of them have a chance to start running. By far the easiest way of
dealing with this is to ensure that variables which need to be private
to each thread are bound on a per-thread basis.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> get two or three new threads running
simultaneously, and convince yourself they're all there.</p>


<a name="output"></a><h3>Where's my output?</h3>

<p>An obvious way to test whether threads are behaving as you imagine
they ought, is to get them to print messages to the listener. For
example, you might feel justified in trying something like:</p>

<pre>
CL-USER 23 &gt; (mp:process-run-function "test" () (lambda () (print 99)))
#&lt;MP:PROCESS Name "test" Priority 850000 State "Running"&gt;

CL-USER 24 &gt; ;; Where's my output?
</pre>

<p>Where indeed is your output? The answer is that your new thread has
a different <code>*standard-output*</code> to the listener, and that's
where your output has gone to. Here is how you might find out where
precisely that is:</p>

<pre>
CL-USER 25 &gt; (mp:process-run-function
              "" ()
              (lambda ()
                (print *standard-output* #.*standard-output*)))
#&lt;MP:PROCESS Name "" Priority 850000 State "Running"&gt;

#&lt;Synonym stream to *TERMINAL-IO*&gt;
CL-USER 26 &gt;
</pre>

<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Open the console
(i.e. <code>*terminal-io*</code>) by evaluating <code>(read-char
*terminal-io*)</code>; type a <code>#\Newline</code> into the console
to return from <code>read-char</code>. Now you can prove directly where
a thread's output goes (by sending something
there). <strong>Warning!</strong> Don't be tempted to close the
console window, or you'll lose your lisp.</p>



<a name="waiting"></a><h3>Waiting</h3>

<p>In all the above examples, a thread is created to run a simple
function and then halt. In a typical application at least some of your
threads will run an <cite>event loop</cite> of some sort. An event
loop is a function which repeatedly waits for an external event to
occur. When an event is noticed, it is dispatched (maybe to another
thread) for processing and the event loop cycles back to its waiting
state. The "other thread" here might already exist (perhaps running an
event loop of its own) or might be created specifically to perform
this task (i.e. handle a single event) and then terminate.</p>

<p>It might be tempting to construct an event loop using
<code>cl:sleep</code>. For example:</p>

<pre>
(defun bogus-event-loop ()
  (loop
   (sleep 1)                        ; THIS IS WRONG
   (when (something-has-happened)
     (act-on-that-thing))))

(mp:process-run-function "Bogus event loop" ()
                         'bogus-event-loop)
</pre>

<p>This is a poor choice, because you're condemned to waiting for the
<code>sleep</code> to return before you can perform the wake-up
test. (Also, it's possible that your implementation cannot sleep one
single thread without sleeping the whole lisp process. In such cases,
any processing required before the predicate
<code>something-has-happened</code> can return true will never happen.)</p>

<p>Consider instead:</p>

<pre>
(defun improved-event-loop ()
  (loop
   (mp:process-wait "Waiting for something to happen"
                    'something-has-happened)
   (act-on-that-thing)))
</pre>

<p>The arguments to <code>mp:process-wait</code> are a string (which
you should use for describing what this thread is waiting for), a
function and optionally arguments to that function. The current thread
will effectively sleep until the function returns true. The function
can watch either internal state...</p>

<pre>
(defun flush-entries-to-file (entries-symbol max-length file)
  (loop
   ;; Wait until we have enough entries to justify going to disk.
   (mp:process-wait (format nil "Waiting for ~a entr~:@p" max-length)
                    (lambda ()
                      (>= (length (symbol-value entries-symbol)) max-length)))
   ;; In this example, don't bother to spawn off a new thread to
   ;; perform the task.
   (let ((entries (shiftf (symbol-value entries-symbol) nil)))
     (with-open-file (ostream file
                              :direction :output
                              :if-exists :append
			      :if-does-not-exist :create)
       (format ostream "~%Flushing entries:")
       (dolist (entry (reverse entries))
         (print entry ostream))))))

;; Test bed to drive the event loop
(defvar *test-entries* nil)
(defvar *test-file* "c:/temp/test-flush-entries.txt")
(defun test-flush-entries-to-file ()
  (let ((tester
         (mp:process-run-function "Test writing entries to file" ()
                                  'flush-entries-to-file
                                  '*test-entries*
                                  10
                                  *test-file*)))
    (dotimes (i 100)
      (push i *test-entries*)
      ;; Without the delay introduced by sleep, all 100 entries are
      ;; generated before the flusher has a chance to wake up.
      (sleep 0.1))
    (mp:process-kill tester)))
</pre>

<p>... or external state...</p>

<pre>
(defun flush-entries-from-file (file reporting-stream)
  (loop
   ;; Wait for given file to exist on disk.
   (mp:process-wait (format nil "Waiting for ~a" file)
                    'probe-file file)
   ;; Empty the file to the reporting-stream, being careful to
   ;; allow more contents to accumulate while this is happening.
   (format reporting-stream "~&amp;Reading ~a:~%" file)
   (let ((temp-file (format nil "~a.temp" file)))
     (rename-file file temp-file)
     (with-open-file (istream temp-file)
       (loop (let ((line (read-line istream nil)))
               (unless line
                 (return))
               (write-line line reporting-stream))))
     (delete-file temp-file))))

(defun test-flush-entries-from-file ()
  (delete-file *test-file*)
  (let ((tester
         (mp:process-run-function "Test reading entries from file" ()
                                  'flush-entries-from-file
                                  *test-file*
                                  *standard-output*)))
    ;; Use the previous example to create test data for this test.
    (test-flush-entries-to-log-file)
    (mp:process-kill tester)))
</pre>

<p>Although both of these examples were somewhat contrived, note their
intentions to preserve their data from external modification once the
waiting threads have woken up. In the first example,
<code>shiftf</code> is used to atomically retrieve a symbol-value and
reset it. In the above examples, this level of care didn't
particularly matter, but in some applications it may be important to
keep threads from trampling on each other's data.</p>

<p>Note also the use of <code>mp:process-kill</code> to terminate
unwanted threads when each test is complete.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Create and test a thread which will wait
until the symbol <code>foo</code> is <code>boundp</code> and then
announce the fact.</p>


<a name="state"></a><h3>Per-thread state</h3>

<p>Every thread in your lisp system has its own execution stack and
hence its own private state. The following aspects of state will
therefore vary between different threads:</p>

<ul>
<li>bindings of dynamic variables;</li>
<li><code>catch</code> tags;</li>
<li>condition handlers, <code>unwind-protect</code>, etc.;</li>
</ul>

<p>On the other hand, the following are globally <strong>set</strong>
rather than <strong>bound</strong> in a lisp system and so will not
vary between threads:</p>

<ul>
<li>definitions of functions, methods, classes, conditions, packages;</li>
<li>contents of any "compound" objects: cons cells, arrays, structure
objects, CLOS objects, hash-tables;</li>
<li>values of lexical variables in shared closures;</li>
<li>state of any stream;</li>
<li>symbol property-lists.</li>
</ul>

<p>To see how per-thread variable bindings can lead you astray,
consider the following examples:</p>

<pre>
CL-USER 34 &gt; (defvar *foo* nil)
*FOO*

CL-USER 35 &gt; (mp:process-run-function "" () (lambda () (setf *foo* 1)))
#&lt;MP:PROCESS Name "" Priority 850000 State "Running"&gt;

CL-USER 36 &gt; *foo*
1

CL-USER 37 &gt; (mp:process-run-function
              "Bind in new thread, can't see elsewhere." ()
              (lambda ()
                (let ((*foo* 2))
                  (sleep 5)
		  (setf *foo* 3)
                  (print 'done #.*standard-output*))))
#&lt;MP:PROCESS Name "" Priority 850000 State "Running"&gt;

CL-USER 38 &gt; *foo*
1

DONE
CL-USER 39 &gt; (let ((*foo* 4))
               (mp:process-run-function
                "Bind in old thread, can't see elsewhere." ()
                (lambda () (print *foo* #.*standard-output*))))
#&lt;MP:PROCESS Name "" Priority 850000 State "Running"&gt;

1
CL-USER 40 &gt;
</pre>

<p>In both lines 34 and 35, <code>*foo*</code> is globally
<strong>set</strong>. This means that every thread shares the symbol's
value. In line 37, <code>*foo*</code> is <strong>bound</strong> only
within the new thread; the original thread (i.e. the listener) does
not see this binding or the result of a <code>setf</code> within the
binding. Similarly, in line 39 the <strong>binding</strong> is present
only in the original thread. To create a binding in a new thread, use
<code>mp:*process-initial-bindings*</code>:</p>

<pre>
CL-USER 40 &gt; (let ((mp:*process-initial-bindings*
                    ;; Note the "dotted list" format - an unpleasant trap
		    ;; for the unwary. Note also that new value is pushed
		    ;; onto existing list so that system defaults aren't lost.
                    (cons '(*foo* . 5) mp:*process-initial-bindings*)))
               (mp:process-run-function
                "Bind around new thread." ()
                (lambda ()
                  (print *foo* #.*standard-output*))))
#&lt;MP:PROCESS Name "Bind around new thread." Priority 850000 State "Running"&gt;

5
CL-USER 41 &gt;
</pre>

<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Explain from examination of
<code>mp:*process-initial-bindings*</code> why calling
<code>in-package</code> in one listener does not affect the package in
another.</p>

<a name="mailbox"></a><h3>Mailboxes</h3>

<p>The mailbox is a structure designed to facilitate the transfer of
data between threads. A number of operations are defined on mailboxes
and are guaranteed to be <cite>thread safe</cite> - that is, different
threads can invoke any number of these operations "at the same time"
without corrupting the mailbox structure.</p>

<p>The following example uses mailboxes to transfer "data" from ten
"generating" threads to one "processing" thread. The function
<code>mp:mailbox-send</code> takes a mailbox and an arbitrary lisp
object as its arguments. Objects sent to the mailbox are queued in
<cite>FIFO</cite> (first in, first out) order, and are retrieved by
calling <code>mp:mailbox-read</code>. Note that this this function
will hang if the mailbox is empty when it is invoked; the wait reason
and timeout are optional arguments. Note also how the timeout is used
here to terminate the "processing" thread after the data have stopped
arriving.</p>

<pre>
(in-package "CL-USER")

;; process-data creates a thread which watches for data being
;; sent to its mailbox and then "processes" them.
(defun process-data (ostream)
  (let ((mailbox))
    (mp:process-run-function
     "Process data" ()
     (lambda ()
       ;; Create a mailbox
       (setf mailbox (mp:make-mailbox))
       (loop
        ;; Wait for someone to write to the mailbox
        (let ((datum (mp:mailbox-read mailbox
                                      "Waiting for data to process"
                                      5)))
          ;; "Process" the result
          (if datum
              (format ostream "~&amp;Processing ~a.~%" datum)
            ;; Looks like everyone else went away. Terminate self.
            (return))))))
    ;; See the Slightly Tougher Exercise below...
    (mp:process-wait "Waiting for mailbox to exist."
                     (lambda () mailbox))
    ;; Return mailbox so that others can share it.
    mailbox))

;; generate-data is called by each "generator" thread, to send
;; 100 data to the mailbox. Each thread will die when its call to this
;; function returns.
(defun generate-data (id mailbox)
  (loop for count to 100 do
        (let ((datum (cons id count)))
          (sleep (random 1.0))
          (mp:mailbox-send mailbox datum))))

;; Pass mailbox from "processor" to various "generators".
(defun mailbox-demo ()
  (let ((mailbox (process-data *standard-output*)))
    (loop for id to 10 do
          (mp:process-run-function
           (format nil "Generator ~d." id) ()
           'generate-data
           id
           mailbox))))
</pre>

<p><strong>Slightly Tougher Exercise:</strong> Consider the call to
<code>mp:process-wait</code> in the example above. Explain what will
happen -- and why -- if (a) the call is removed and (b) the call is
replaced by:</p>

<pre>
    (mp:process-wait "Waiting for mailbox to exist."
                     'identity
		      mailbox)
</pre>

<a name="interrupts"></a><h3>Interrupts</h3>

<p>The above sections have dealt with ways of using
<strong>data</strong> to communicate between threads. Another
important mode of communication is the <cite>interrupt</cite>: a
message sent by one thread to another, to tell that thread to stop
whatever it was doing and get on with something else instead. This
might come in handy if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you need certain actions to be performed synchronously - for
example you need your web server to flush some cache before it accepts
any further connections; or</li>
<li>you need actions to be performed in the dynamic context of another
thread.</li>
</ul>

<p>To interrupt a thread, use the function
<code>mp:process-interrupt</code>. This takes a thread as its first
argument, followed by a function and optionally arguments to that
function. As elsewhere, you can use
<code>mp:find-process-from-name</code> to locate the thread object
corresponding to a given name. For example:</p>

<pre>
(defun flush-cache (cache)
  (let ((tcp-server (mp:find-process-from-name "Port 80 server")))

<p>A related utility is <code>mp:process-interrupt-list</code>, which
takes just three arguments: a thread, a function, a list of arguments
to that function.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Use
<code>mp:*process-initial-bindings*</code> to create a thread whose
<code>*standard-output*</code> is the listener you're working in. Set
this thread to sleeping for a long time (1000 seconds will do). Now
create a second thread without the redirected
<code>*standard-output*</code>, and have it ask the sleeper to print
something for it.</p>


<a name="capi"></a><h3>Threads and the CAPI windowing system</h3>

<p>By default, every CAPI interface runs in its own thread. This
thread will be used by the lisp system for actions such as redisplay
and invocation of callbacks. If you need to act programmatically on a
CAPI interface, you are <strong>strongly recommended</strong> to work
in the appropriate thread.</p>

<p>The utility <code>capi:execute-with-interface</code> will help you
out here. This takes as its first argument a <cite>CAPI
interface</cite>; subsequent arguments are a function followed by
optional arguments to that function. The function will be invoked in
the thread belonging to that interface. To get from any CAPI element
to its interface, use the reader <code>capi:element-interface</code>,
as in the following example.</p>

<p>In this example, the <code>only</code> way to get
<code>*switchable*</code> to switch is to execute the request in
<code>*switchable*</code>'s thread.</p>

<pre>
;; Create and display a window which can switch between
;; two children. These have different coloured backgrounds.
;; Red was listed first and so by default is visible initially.
(defvar *switchable*
  (let ((red-pane (make-instance 'capi:output-pane
                                 :name 'red
                                 :background :red))
        (green-pane (make-instance 'capi:output-pane
                                   :name 'green
                                   :background :green)))
    (capi:contain
     (make-instance 'capi:switchable-layout
                    :description (list red-pane green-pane)))))

;; Utility to return the green child.
(defun green-pane (switchable)
  (find 'green (capi:switchable-layout-switchable-children
                switchable)
        :key 'capi:capi-object-name))

;; If you try this then (a) you'll get an error and (b) calling
;; (right *switchable*) won't help - that window's state is broken
;; and you'll have to create a new one.
(defun wrong (switchable)
  (setf (capi:switchable-layout-visible-child switchable)
        (green-pane switchable)))

(defun right (switchable)
  (capi:execute-with-interface
   (capi:element-interface switchable)
   (lambda (switchable)
     (setf (capi:switchable-layout-visible-child switchable)
           (green-pane switchable)))
   switchable))
</pre>

<a name="locks"></a><h3>Locks</h3>

<p>Sometimes it's important to control access to some resource, so
that only one thread is operating on it at a time. One method of
effecting this is to restrict access from your code to that resource
to one (or more) specialised threads, and to have other threads write
to a mailbox when they want the specialised threads to access the
resource on their behalf. However there are two potential drawbacks
to this approach.</p>

<ul>
<li>Frequently you'll need to wait in the invoking thread until the
operation on the resource is complete. </li>
<li>This is becoming a somewhat heavyweight mechanism for handling
what should be a fairly simple operation.</li>
</ul>

<p>A <cite>lock</cite> is a simple lisp object, which can be
<cite>held</cite> by no more than one thread at a time. A thread
attempting to hold a lock which is already in use will hang (i.e. be
forced to wait) until the lock is freed. In the following example, the
locking mechanism is reduced to its most minimal form.</p>

<pre>
;; Create a lock and remember it.
(defvar *lock* (mp:make-lock))

(defun use-resource-when-free (id stream)
  ;; Callers must wait at this point for the lock to
  ;; be freed, before they can proceed with the body of
  ;; this form.
  (mp:with-lock (*lock*)
    (use-resource-anyway id stream)
    ;; When we exit the form, the lock is freed automatically
    ;; and some other thread will be allowed to claim it.
    ))

(defun use-resource-anyway (id stream)
  (format stream "~&amp;Starting ~a." id)
  (sleep 1)
  (format stream "~&amp;Ending ~a." id))

(defun test (lock-p)
  (let ((run-function (if lock-p
                          'use-resource-when-free
                        'use-resource-anyway)))
    (dotimes (id 3)
      (mp:process-run-function
       (format nil "Competing thread ~a" id) nil
       run-function id *standard-output*))))
</pre>


<a name="timers"></a><h3>A brief warning about timers</h3>

<p>Timers are a handy way of notifying your application that some
period of time has elapsed. You should however be aware of the
following vital piece of information: <strong>TIMERS RUN IN THE IDLE
PROCESS</strong>...</p>

<pre>
CL-USER 62 &gt; (defun foo () (print mp:*current-process*
                                  #.*standard-output*))
FOO

CL-USER 63 &gt; (setf *timer* (mp:make-timer 'foo))
#&lt;Time Event : FOO&gt;

CL-USER 64 &gt; (mp:schedule-timer-relative *timer* 1 1)
#&lt;Time Event : FOO&gt;

#&lt;MP:PROCESS Name "The idle process" Priority -8388608 State "Running"&gt;
#&lt;MP:PROCESS Name "The idle process" Priority -8388608 State "Running"&gt;
#&lt;MP:PROCESS Name "The idle process" Priority -8388608 State "Running"&gt;
#&lt;MP:PROCESS Name "The idle process" Priority -8388608 State "Running"&gt;
CL-USER 65 &gt; (mp:unschedule-timer *timer*)
#&lt;Time Event : FOO&gt;

CL-USER 66 &gt;
</pre>

<p>A consequence of this is that any errors you get in
a timer are errors in the idle process, which is the manager for
multiprocessing and generally a Bad Place to Get Errors. This was
potentially a more serious problem in LispWorks 4.1; it looks safer
(i.e. non fatal) in LispWorks 4.2. In any case, you are advised always
to switch to another process to run the contents of your timer.</p>

<pre>
(defvar *timer*)
(defparameter *housekeeping-interval* 3600)      ; once per hour

;; Create a timer, set it to "expire" in one hour, and subsequently at
;; hourly intervals.
(defun start-timer ()
  (setf *timer* (mp:make-timer 'safe-housekeeping))
  (mp:schedule-timer-relative *timer*
                              *housekeeping-interval*
			      *housekeeping-interval*))

; Switch thread, so we can't possibly get errors in the idle process ;-(
(defun safe-housekeeping ()
  (mp:process-run-function "Housekeeping" nil
                           'housekeeping))
</pre>

<a name="initializing"></a><h3>Initializing multithreading</h3>

<p>As noted previously, multithreading is "always" running in the
LispWorks for Windows environment. However, while the image is
initializing itself (loading your ".lispworks" file, for example, or
running a <code>:restart-function</code> supplied to
<code>save-image</code>), multithreading has not yet started and so
"inter-thread" functions such as <code>mp:process-run-function</code>
and <code>mp:process-wait</code> cannot be called.</p>

<p>There are circumstances in which you will want to start
multithreading yourself:</p>

<ul>
<li>on platforms where you must explicitly call
<code>(env:start-environment)</code> to launch the CAPI development
environment - this function will start multithreading if that hasn't
already happened;</li>
<li>you might want access to multithreading functionality from the
non-windowing listener;</li>
<li>you might want a resaved image to execute code which requires
multithreading.</li>
</ul>

<p>If in doubt, you can tell whether multithreading has started yet by
examining either <code>mp:*current-process*</code> or
<code>(mp:list-all-processes)</code>. If either of these is null,
multithreading hasn't started.</p>

<p>To start multithreading, call
<code>(mp:initialize-multiprocessing)</code>. Specify the threads that
should run on startup of multithreading via the variable
<code>mp:*initial-processes*</code>. This is a list whose members are
themselves lists to which <code>mp:process-run-function</code> can be
applied. <strong>Warning:</strong> do not remove any entries which the
implementation has placed on <code>mp:*initial-processes*</code>.</p>

<p>Note that <code>(mp:initialize-multiprocessing)</code>
does not return until all threads have run to completion, at which
point multithreading itself halts. If you call it from the
non-windowing listener without specifying any threads to run,
<code>(mp:initialize-multiprocessing)</code> will appear to return no
values immediately, but appearances can be deceptive - what
actually happens is that LispWorks is designed to spot that
multithreading has been started without any threads to run, and so to
give you a "default listener" (in its own thread) rather than leaving
you with a hung lisp.</p>

<p>The above ideas are illustrated by the following example. To run
this on Windows or Linux, you will need to resave the image to run in
the TTY (without multithreading on startup), by passing the keyword
argument <code>:environment nil</code> to <code>save-image</code>.</p>
