;; "C-s" does an incremental search forward (e.g. - as each key is
;; the search string is entered, the source file is searched for the
;; first match. This can make finding specific text much quicker as
;; you only need to type in the unique characters. Repeat searches
;; (using the same search characters) can be done by repeatedly
;; pressing "C-s"
     
;; "C-r" does an incremental search backward

;; "C-s RET" and "C-r RET" both do conventional string searches
;; (forward and backward respectively)

;; "C-M-s" and "C-M-r" both do regular expression searches (forward
;; and backward respectively)
     
;; "M-%" does a search/replace while "C-M-%" does a regular
;; expression search/replace
