</ul>

The ANSI Common Lisp standard doesn't mention this topic. (Keep in
mind that it was written at a time where 
<a href="http://kogs-www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/~moeller/symbolics-info/symbolics.html">Lisp
Machines</a> were at their peak. On these boxes Lisp <em>was</em> your
operating system!) So almost everything that can be said here depends
on your OS and your implementation. 


<a name="env"></a>
<h3>Accessing Environment variables</h3>

Here's a function that'll allow you to look at Unix/Linux environment
variables on a lot of different CL implementations: 

<pre>
* (defun my-getenv (name &optional default)
    #+CMU
    (let ((x (assoc name ext:*environment-list*
                    :test #'string=)))
      (if x (cdr x) default))
    #-CMU
    (or 
     #+Allegro (sys:getenv name)
     #+CLISP (ext:getenv name)
     #+ECL (si:getenv name)
     #+SBCL (sb-unix::posix-getenv name)
     #+LISPWORKS (lispworks:environment-variable name)
     default))
MY-GETENV
* (my-getenv "HOME")
"/home/edi"
* (my-getenv "HOM")
NIL
* (my-getenv "HOM" "huh?")
"huh?"
</pre>

You should also note that some of these implementations also provide
the ability to <em>set</em> these variables. These include ECL
(<code>SI:SETENV</code>) and AllegroCL, LispWorks, and CLISP where
you can use the functions from above together with 
<a href="http://www.xanalys.com/software_tools/reference/HyperSpec/Body/m_setf_.htm"><code>SETF</code></A>.
This feature might be important if you want to start subprocesses from
your Lisp environment.
