<h3>Re-using complex data structures</h3>

Sometimes you want your functions to behave in a 'functional' way,
i.e. return <a
href="http://www.lispworks.com/reference/HyperSpec/Body/26_glo_f.htm#fresh">fresh</a>
results without side effects, sometimes you want them to re-use and
modify existing data in a destructive way - consider the difference
between <a
href="http://www.lispworks.com/reference/HyperSpec/Body/f_append.htm"><code>APPEND</code></a>
and <a
href="http://www.lispworks.com/reference/HyperSpec/Body/f_nconc.htm"><code>NCONC</code></a>
for an example.

<p>
Well, you can have your cake and eat it too, by using optional (or
keyword) parameters. Here's an example: Let's assume you're writing a
function <code>COMPLEX-MATRIX-STUFF</code> which takes two matrices
<code>M1</code> and <code>M2</code> as its arguments and computes and
returns a resulting matrix the size of which depends on
<code>M1</code> and <code>M2</code>, i.e. for a fresh result you'll
need an empty matrix which'll be created by, say,
<code>(MAKE-APPROPRIATE-RESULT-MATRIX-FOR M1 M2)</code>.

<p>
The classical textbook way to implement this function will more or
less look like this:

<pre>
(defun complex-matrix-stuff (m1 m2)
  (let ((result (make-appropriate-result-matrix-for m1 m2)))
    ;; ... compute storing the results in RESULT
    result))
</pre>

And you'll use it like this:

<pre>
(setq some-matrix (complex-matrix-stuff A B))
</pre>

But why not write it like so:
<pre>
(defun complex-matrix-stuff (m1 m2
                             &optional
                             (result
                              (make-appropriate-result-matrix-for m1 m2)))
  ;; ... compute storing the results in RESULT
  result)
</pre>
 
Now you have it both ways.  You can still &quot;make up results&quot;
on the fly as in:
 
<pre>
(setq some-matrix (complex-matrix-stuff A B))
</pre>

But you can also (destructively) re-use previously allocated matrices:
 
<pre>
(complex-matrix-stuff A B some-appropriate-matrix-I-built-before)
</pre>

Or use your function like this:

<pre>
(setq some-other-matrix
        (complex-matrix-stuff A B some-appropriate-matrix-I-built-before))
</pre>

in which case you'll end up with:
 
<pre>
* (eq some-other-matrix some-appropriate-matrix-I-built-before)

T
</pre>

<a name="adjust"></a>
<h3>Using <code>ADJUST-ARRAY</code> instead of consing up new sequences with <code>SUBSEQ</code></h3>

Most CL functions operating on sequences will accept
<code>START</code> and <code>END</code> keywords so you can make them
operate on a sub-sequence without actually creating it, i.e. instead of

<pre>
(count #\a (subseq long-string from to))
</pre>

you should of course use

<pre>
(count #\a long-string :start from :end to)
</pre>

which'll yield the same result but not create an unnecessary
intermediate sub-sequence.
<p>
However, sometimes it looks like you can't avoid creating new
data. Consider a hash table the keys of which are strings. If the key
you're looking for is a sub-string of another string you'll most
likely end up with

<pre>
(gethash (subseq original-string from to)
         has-table)
</pre>

But you don't have to. You can create <em>one</em> <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/reference/HyperSpec/Body/26_glo_d.htm#displaced_array">displaced</a> string and reuse
it multiple times with <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/reference/HyperSpec/Body/f_adjust.htm"><code>ADJUST-ARRAY</code></a>:

<pre>
(let ((substring (make-array 0
                             :element-type 'character
                             :displaced-to ""
                             :displaced-index-offset 0)))
  ;; more code
  (gethash 
   (adjust-array substring (- to from)
                 :displaced-to original-string
                 :displaced-index-offset from)
   hash-table)
  ;; even more code
  )
</pre>
